Her first appearance on the small screen came in 1996 on All That. She made such an impression, she was then given her own Nickelodeon spin-off, The Amanda Show in 1999. She went on to achieve much more success, but problems in her personal life made it all ‘come to an end’ more than a decade later. We take a look at what Amanda Bynes herself has said about her rise and fall in Hollywood.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star has now made her way back into the public eye after she was placed under legal guardianship in 2013. Her parents filed to place her under this following what the <a href=#>movie</a> star described to be a ‘dark period in her life’. She returned with the launch of her podcast with friend, Paul Sieminski but ‘issues’ meant the great comeback, with a whole new look, was canceled, and to this date, only one episode is available for fans to listen to.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-90711078-703x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1996-2010-amanda-bynes-rocked-the-entertainment-industry-for-more-than-a-decade>1996 – 2010: Amanda Bynes ‘rocked’ the entertainment industry for more than a decade</h2><p>The Amanda Show, starring <a href=#>Drake Bell and Josh Peck</a>, was such a hit, that Bynes won the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award for Favorite <a href=#>TV</a> Actress three years in a row.</p><p>In 2002, she made her film debut in Big Fat Liar and her career went on the up from there. She then went on to star in the hit sitcom, What I Like About You, starred with <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> on Teen Queens, and then featured in the iconic She’s The Man alongside Channing Tatum in 2006.</p><p>However, in 2010 the cracks began to show, just before starring in her final role in a major movie to date, Easy A.</p><p>Just before the release in 2010, Bynes, who was 24 at the time took to X, which was then known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> to announce her retirement from acting.</p><p>“Being an actress isn’t as fun as it may seem,” she tweeted. “I know 24 is a young age to retire, but you heard it here first: I’ve retired.”</p><p>However, weeks later, she announced she had ‘unretired’ posting the trailer to the romcom, which grossed $17 million in its first weekend.</p><p>“I literally couldn’t stand my appearance in that movie and I didn’t like my performance. I was absolutely convinced I needed to stop acting after seeing it,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Paper Magazine in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2012-cracks-in-the-star-s-personal-life-began-to-show>2012: Cracks in the star’s personal life began to show</h2><p>Two years after the release of her final film, the star was arrested on suspicion of DUI in April 2012, and was charged two months later with two misdemeanor counts of hit-and-run.</p><p>A year later, she was arrested yet again for ‘throwing a bong’ out the window of her NYC apartment. Around this time, the star was going through a ‘public meltdown’ and was changing up her appearance with a variety of colorful wigs.</p><p>For her June 2013 court appearance, she could be smiling heading into the court, whilst wearing a bright blue wig.</p><p>She was then thought to have started a small fire in the drive of a home in California and was placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold. During this time, she was placed under legal guardianship, similar to that of <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>.</p><p>The now 37-year-old was released from rehab in December 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-173171638-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2018-amanda-s-comeback-to-the-industry-takes-a-turn-for-the-worst>2018: Amanda’s comeback to the industry takes a turn for the worst</h2><p>After a quiet few years, Bynes gave her first interview in years in 2017, talking to Hollyscoop’s Diana Madison.</p><p>She then opened up with a huge spread on Paper Magazine, candidly speaking about her struggle with substance abuse and expressing her regret for her Twitter rants back in the day.</p><p>“I’m really ashamed and embarrassed with the things I said. I can’t turn back time but if I could, I would. And I’m so sorry to whoever I hurt and whoever I lied about because it truly eats away at me,” she said.</p><p>However, at the start of 2019, it was reported she had been taken back into rehab after a setback following ‘the pressure of being back in the spotlight’ after the huge ‘comeback interview’.</p><p>Five years later, things were looking on the up for the star, as a Judge ended her nine-year conservatorship.</p><p>“I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years,” she said in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> to PEOPLE at the time.</p><p>“In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2024-amanda-makes-her-showbiz-return-with-a-podcast-but-it-didn-t-last-long>2024: Amanda makes her showbiz return with a Podcast – but it didn’t last long</h2><p>In December 2023, Amanda took part in her <a href=#>first ‘on-screen project’ since Easy A</a> – a podcast with her friend, Paul Siminski, titled Amanda Bynes & Paul Sieminski: The Podcast.</p><p>As well as a new venture, she also debuted a new look, blonde hair, and a heart-shaped face tattoo, which she had inked in 2019. The former child actress also admitted to blepharoplasty surgery on the skin folds in the corners of her eyes.</p><p>“It was one of the best things I could have done for my self-confidence, and it made me feel a lot better in my skin,” she gushed.</p><p>However, after just one week and one episode, she announced she was ending her podcast, despite the first episode doing really well.</p><p>In an <a href=#>Instagram</a> story, she explained she would “rather get my manicurist license and have a consistent job.”</p><p>She also announced the show was being ‘put on pause’ as she failed to line up high-profile guests such as <a href=#>Drake</a> and Post Malone.</p><p>As for now, she continues to update fans with her ongoings via her Instagram story. We’ll be keeping an eye out for the Drake episode in the future!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aGcK3MmqWdmV2Xxq%2Bx0maamqqVmr9uvsisnGaZnpl6p63LpWSorpWnerW0xGawnpmiqHqiusNmq6GdXaS7pnnMqK2inV2ptaLAjKaYnZ1dnbKzedGeq6KqlWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charlotte-church-launches-new-bikini-diet-just-breathe-in-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charlotte Church launches new bikini diet (just breathe in)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stocking-stuffers-for-women.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>36 Best Stocking Stuffers for Women in 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
