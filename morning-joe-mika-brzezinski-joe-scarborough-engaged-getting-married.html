Scarborough split from his second wife in 2013, while Brzezinski called it quits with her former husband of 23 years in 2015.</p><p>"Everyone talks about how there was always something there,” Brzezinski said. "Over the past year and a half, I realized I had to face these feelings and that it was time to stop putting them in a box. It was not an easy process and it was not an easy set of decisions for either of us. It was something I couldn't deny anymore."</p><p>The engagement went down during a trip to the Hotel du Cap in Antibes -- a resort town in France -- where they traveled to for Brzezinski's 50th birthday, but on the last night of their trip, Scarborough pulled a diamond surprise out of his pocket while they were overlooking the Mediterranean.</p><p>“When I saw him on one knee, I started laughing nervously, almost hysterically,” she said. “And then he asked, and I said, 'Absolutely.'”</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a1f5083e-9feb-5cdc-bcf6-884e7dfcdbe2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:37d2d4fe-31f4-52ae-b366-e5eafd11df53 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/5by4/2017/03/21/05ba6ab99eaa5df587da63058065c148_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>'Morning Joe' Goes Off on 'Little Kid' Trump: 'All He Does Is Watch TV' (Video)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The couple didn't appear to want to address their personal lives on the air Thursday morning, but panelist Harold Ford Jr. tried.</p><p>"First of all can I say something?" he said.
