The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star was not only a clever comic, but also a talented actor who excelled at various roles. From sinister tales in One Hour Photo to the tear-jerking story of Good Will Hunting – he did it all. But there was one <a href=#>movie</a> he was willing to be a part of that he never got the chance.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robin-williams-was-turned-down-for-harry-potter-movie>Robin Williams was turned down for Harry Potter movie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-134396505-1024x683.jpg><p>Robin Williams, movie legend, doting father and hilarious comedian, tragically died in 2014. The master improviser was an incredible voice actor whose career spanned over four decades.</p><p>After succeeding in stand-up comedy, which he once described as a “brutal field”, he became a household name with <a href=#>TV’s</a> Mork & Mindy. This is where his quick-wit and improvised lines made him stand out.</p><p>He ventured into the silver screen in the 1970s, with his first big break being Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987. After, he became cherished by millions for his good feeling flicks such as Patch Adams, Hook and Bicentennial Man.</p><p>The last film that released when he was still alive was The Angriest Man In Brooklyn. It follows a bitter man who tries to change his life after he’s told by his doctor that he has a <a href=#>terminal illness</a>.</p><p>Despite the monumental success, there was one movie that he wanted to do but was turned down. He reached out to take part in the <a href=#>Harry Potter movies</a>, believing he would perfect for one of the supporting roles.</p><p>However, author J. K. Rowling had a strict rule which meant he would never even be asked to audition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-j-k-rowling-s-strict-rule-for-the-casting-of-harry-potter>J. K. Rowling’s strict rule for the casting of Harry Potter</h2><p>The creator of the famous wizarding world prohibited Williams from being part of the cast, despite the star contacting Chris Columbus, the director of the first two movies.</p><p>He had set his heart on the role of Hagrid. He’s the loveable half-giant who is worth more than his weight in gold. Robin wanted to audition for the Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, but didn’t get his foot in the door.</p><p>The director had to turn him down, though, because JK enforced a rule that only a British cast were involved in the franchise.</p><p>The part eventually went to the late Robbie Coltrane, who was a fantastic casting.</p><p>Janet Hirshenson, casting director for the&nbsp;films explained what went down. She <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> the&nbsp;Huffington Post in 2016: “Robin had called him because he really wanted to be in the movie, but it was a British-only edict, and once he said no to Robin, he wasn’t going to say yes to anybody else, that’s for sure.”</p><p>That’s not all. Williams must have fallen in love with the tales of magic as he approached Columbus again. This time, he showed interest in Defense of the Dark Arts professor role of Remus Lupin. Lupin is introduced in the third book and movie of the franchise. Sadly, Columbus had to make the “difficult” step of saying no for the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban part.</p><p>The director explained it wasn’t easy. He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Total Film: “I had a conversation with Robin Williams, who wanted to play Lupin. It was very difficult for me to say, ‘It’s all British. There’s nothing I can do.'”</p><p>He later admitted Williams would have been “brilliant”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-american-actor-who-managed-to-get-through-the-cracks>The American actor who managed to get through the cracks</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rest In Peace Verne Troyer!

However, there was actually an American actor in one of the films, which it makes it harder to swallow.</p><p>Verne Troyer, known for portraying Mini-Me in Austin Powers, was in one of the films.</p><p>He played Griphook in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone [Philosopher’s Stone]. He’s one of the goblins in Gringotts Wizarding Bank along Diagon Alley.</p><p>Although he was on camera, Warwick Davis voiced the character over the top.</p><p>Davis later took over the role in a recast when Griphook returns in the Deathly Hallows’ two movies.</p><p>To add more salt into the wound, Columbus’ daughter Eleanor appeared in scenes as a Hufflepuff student named Susan Bones.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-world-still-mourns-over-movie-legend-robin-williams>The world still mourns over movie legend Robin Williams</h2><p>The Chicago native sadly died from suicide after being diagnosed with Lewy body dementia. His widow, Susan Schneider Williams, later said it was this presence that “took his life”, also referring to his earlier diagnosis of Parkinson’s. The star had battled depression and anxiety, which the Lewy Body Dementia Association later said can occur with someone who has either disease.</p><p>Following a memorial, Robin’s ashes were scattered across San Francisco Bay.</p><p>Tributes flooded in across the world after movie fans heard the tragic news of Robin Williams.</p><p>His daughter Zelda said “the world is forever a little darker, less colorful and less full of laughter” after his passing.</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
