It proved so popular, it has been put permanently on sale.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eco brand Green People launched two dog shampoos this year, and beauty favourite Kiehl’s even has a hair conditioner for dogs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a post-pandemic world in which 33 per cent of UK households own a dog and sales of pet grooming products rose by 11.3 per cent in the past year, it was perhaps only a matter of time before beauty houses cashed in.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But can spending over £20 on a bottle of dog shampoo be justified? Yes, you need a product intended for pets — human skin is more acidic than a dog’s, so our shampoos can leave their skin dry and irritated — but the £4 version from our local supermarket that we lather on Herbie every couple of months seems to do the trick.
