He has starred in acclaimed films such as The Umbrella Academy</h3><p class=align-left>Robert's interest in acting began in <a href=#>primary school </a>when he perfectly played Oliver in the film<i> Oliver with a Twist</i>. He then auditioned and won the<i> Song for Raggy Boy</i> role in 2003. He later starred in several Irish productions before gaining international recognition for his role in the popular <a href=#>TV series</a><i> Misfits</i> in 2009.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/60272906549f5907.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All about Emily Compagno's sisters, Natalie and Julietta</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since then, Sheehan has appeared in various movies and TV shows, showcasing his range as an actor.

The star identifies himself as heterosexual</h3><p class=align-left>Sheehan's love story has had some speculations in the past. The actor shared how he planned his first kiss with a man. Robert was so determined to figure out his feelings that he got drunk for this occasion of kissing a man to see what would happen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d795597a244d7f41.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Jaya Kelly: The story of R. Kelly's transgender kid</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When he was younger and in early adulthood, he mentioned having a couple of experiences with men where he tried it to see if it did anything for his feelings. So is Robert Sheehan gay? No. Despite experimenting on his sexuality, <a href=#>the star</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">identifies as heterosexual</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The actor revealed that his past promiscuous se*x had diminished its importance in his life. Instead, he viewed it as compulsive unhealthy behaviour.</p><h3>4. The personality was in a long-term relationship with an actress</h3><p class=align-left>Who is Robert Sheehan's wife? Does he have children? Robert is not yet married as of 2023.

However, Robert said his ex-girlfriend is still a friend, and they are on good terms.</p><h3>5. Robert Sheehan struggled with mental health issues</h3><p class=align-left>Robert's and Sofia's break up triggered his mental well-being. He revealed how saddening it was for him. Tedious press interviews and obsession with social media also didn't settle well with him. The star once said that indulging in fame too much could have a negative impact on one's health.</p>Because fame is ultimately about achieving positive self-esteem through external factors, and that's a losing game. You have to just take it all with a pinch of salt, but again fame can be used positively as an actor, so you have to figure out a way of engaging with it and using it to your benefit but not allowing it to create an imbalance internally, that's the trick.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e6267b8404b80b2f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Nicholas James?

The actor also ventured into writing creative stories</h3><p class=align-left>Over the years, Sheehan has realised himself in the acting industry, and during the <a href=#>Covid-19</a> pandemic, he ventured into the field of writing.
