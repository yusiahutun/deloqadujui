The talented dancer awed many with her dancing skills and even won&nbsp;various championships. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Asia participated in the StarPower National Championship at the age of 5 and made history by winning the Championship as she was the youngest to take the title ever.</p><p>Later on, Asia debuted in the television world by participating in the first season of Lifetime’s Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition. She became Abby's Ultimate diva and drew everyone’s attention through her power-packed&nbsp;dancing skills and performances. Despite her young age, she fought till the finale along with the dancer double her age and ended up in the third place, however, by then she was ruling many hearts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Asia then&nbsp;joined the Dance Moms Season 3, where she proved to be a champion by winning every single solo competition she performed. She even attended The Industry Dance Awards in 2014 as the nominee for Favourite Dancer 17 And Under.</p><p>Apart from the journey of dance, Asia has also acted on various TV series including “Sister Code" (2015), "Major Crimes" (2016),&nbsp;“Grey’s Anatomy" (2016) and&nbsp; “American Crime Story: The People v.

I liked being on the other shows, but I was away from my sister Bella Blu and my dad … I missed them a lot. On my show, we are together all the time and I can share my dream of performing with them. They help me in so many ways, especially my mom, but everyone has a role to play in helping me get to the top! I’m very blessed with a supportive and loving family, even when things get a little crazy at times."</p><p>Also, when asked how she would deal with negative feedback regarding her work, she replied,</p><p>"My parents have taught me since a very early age that there will be a lot of people genuinely happy for me if I became a success, but there would be just as many that will dislike me because of it. I’m experiencing some of that now, but I use them as motivators. Nothing bothers them more than continuing to be successful. I pray for them, but I rarely think about them because I’m too busy working and focusing on myself."</p><p><span style="font-family:sans-serif,arial,verdana,trebuchet ms">Just as Asia said in the interview, her parents have indeed helped her grow such strong, standing up for their child's passion. Moreover,&nbsp;</span>Asia&nbsp;beautifully reciprocates the support that she gets from her&nbsp;family.</p><p>Thanking her father for his presence on her life Asia Instagrammed a collage of her sister, her father and herself.</p>&nbsp;The Monet family indeed&nbsp;has an adorable bond, and Asia is lucky to have such loving family around her.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqrmZZ6rrvNnqtmqpGueri1yqJkmp%2BVYrWmtcahq2aokaeyr8DSZpuappOeu6h5xK2fp6GTnsG6eZFpaHBmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5f916a7f268e3e725f8b4634-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blsamo de tigre, el remedio que lo cura casi todo y que triunfa en Amazon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-awesome-computer-cases-with-usb-c-front-panels.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Awesome Computer Cases With USB-C Front Panels</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
