For instance, fear moves us away from danger, sadness teaches us what we value and need to protect, and shame corrects negative behaviours so that we remain socially attached, which is a vital survival mechanism.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Krismer says he shudders when he hears advice that we should be happy no matter what. Not only does this negate the actual experience of our real lives, it can have a cumulative effect that leads to significant mental harm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/29/afe9edc8-c883-11e9-b4e3-f796e392de6b_972x_030132.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He explains: “If fear and sadness are in our experience and we keep ignoring them, then they will generally not go away. We can run away from them or mask them with false positivity or short-term distractions like drinking, shopping and scrolling through social media, but if a negative emotion is significant, it will be relentless. Long-term avoidance of negative emotions may even lead to depression.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Research published in 2018 in the journal Emotion also acknowledged that while promoting happiness is good for our health, its over-promotion and expecting that we should feel happy all the time could backfire, bringing more stress, frustration and disappointment in the long run.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In their report, the researchers stated that emphasising the importance of happiness could make us more likely to obsess over failure. They also looked at the other side of the equation, finding that emphasising the importance of not experiencing negative emotional states (for example, depression and anxiety) was associated with increased rumination. Together, their findings suggest that the over-promotion of happiness, and, in turn, the social pressure not to experience negative emotional states, could affect the way we deal with negative emotions when they do inevitably occur.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If fear and sadness are in our experience and we keep ignoring them, then they will generally not go away... Long-term avoidance of negative emotions may even lead to depressionPaul Krismer, Canadian happiness expert</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next time you experience negative emotions, instead of suppressing or ignoring them, Krismer suggests getting acquainted with them. “When we’re friendly with our negative emotions they become less powerful. We see them for what they are: temporary emotions, because they come and go. When we ignore fear and sadness, for example, they start growing bigger and louder so that you’ll pay attention. If you stop ignoring them, they say their piece and then move on to make room for other emotions.” If the negative emotions are persistent and overwhelming, Krismer recommends talking to a friend or getting professional help.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having negative emotions isn’t a sign of failure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Dr Timothy Sharp, chief happiness officer at The Happiness Institute in Sydney, Australia, negative emotions such as sadness, grief, stress, anxiety, anger and frustration are perfectly normal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/29/c937a32e-c53b-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_972x_030132.JPEG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Thinking that you shouldn’t experience such emotions is not a good way to live, because the simple fact is that we cannot be happy all the time. No one will be or should expect to be happy all the time,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What does genuine optimism feel like? Dr Barbara Fredrickson, director of the Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the US, defines happiness as an umbrella term for any of the following 10 emotions: joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, inspiration, amusement, awe and love.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What Kismer loves about this definition is that it does not tell us that our happiness should feel a certain way. “It’s not always a silly ear-to-ear grin,” he explains. “Different people access happiness in different ways. For example, I’m kind of nerdy, so I like to sit and read non-fiction books. If you were looking at me, you wouldn’t say I looked happy. But because the emotion of interest is very accessible for me, if you asked me how I was feeling while I was reading, I might say something like, ‘Oh, this is so good! I am learning about …’ And then I would tell you excitedly about what I was learning. That kind of happiness is every bit as real and good as any other kind. We should each ‘follow our bliss’ and appreciate that it looks different from time to time and from person to person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/29/ae691ed8-c883-11e9-b4e3-f796e392de6b_1320x770_030132.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you know which of the 10 emotions are most accessible to you, you can structure your life to make those emotions a more frequent experience. If you connect with amusement, for instance, you might go to comedy clubs on a regular basis. If you experience awe readily, you might choose to take a hike in nature every chance you get.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unfortunately, we face many threats to personal happiness. In his experience, Sharp says, the most common factors that detract from happiness include unhelpful and unrealistic definitions of happiness; not prioritising happiness; becoming distracted by consumerism and materialism; focusing on individuality over relationships and connectedness; taking a passive approach to being happy or just ‘waiting’ for happiness to come; comparing ourselves to others, especially on social media; and finally, allowing the extreme negative focus of the news and media to influence the way we look at the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besides practising gratitude daily, Krismer says that regular meditation can help boost happiness. “In as little as eight weeks, a new meditator has measurable changes to the density of their left prefrontal cortex,” he points out. “This is the region in the brain responsible for emotional regulation and contentment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/29/ade20718-c883-11e9-b4e3-f796e392de6b_1320x770_030132.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Meditators are able to mentally separate themselves from their passing thoughts and emotions. This makes obsessive rumination about the past or manic worry about the future both much less likely to occur.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, Krismer believes that it’s important to have meaningful work — whatever that means to you — and to maintain social connections, be it spending quality time with friends and family or engaging with your community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Social connection, he says, is not optional but a must, because research shows that unhealthy mental states – depression and much more – are strongly associated with social disconnection. Of course, there are other reasons for mental illnesses beside social disconnectedness, but where social isolation exists it is often causative of mental health issues and it makes genetic mental health issues worse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And finally, be sure to live a healthy lifestyle –&nbsp;get sufficient sleep, eat a nutritious diet and avoid processed foods, and exercise every day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our mental health is intimately tied to our physical health, so a healthy lifestyle is foundational to happiness,” says Krismer. “We can’t be happy if we don’t take care of ourselves.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxna2xlZ4Zww8eyZK2qqZ67qHnTqKZmoJGnsW6uxGafmqigrnqkrc1mpJqjlWLGsMGMpqCsnaKWr62xjJqlnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./front-row-london-covett-circular-luxury-club.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Would you &amp;quot;time-share&amp;quot; your wardrobe?
