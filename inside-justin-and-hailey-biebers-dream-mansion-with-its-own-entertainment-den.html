Clearly, it wasn’t Yummy enough for him.</strong></p><p>Justin and <a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a>‘s relationship has had fans obsessed. Selenators have kept tabs since the singer split from <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> for good in 2018. Drama ensued months later after the Biebers secretly tied the knot, and despite constant theories about what really happened between the three, the couple are happier than ever. They made their biggest <a href=#>real estate</a> investment in 2020 with the purchase of a $25.8 million mansion after the singer attempted to sell his then-home to fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1340143259-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justin-and-hailey-bieber-s-newlywed-home-had-a-slushie-machine>Justin and Hailey Bieber’s newlywed home had a slushie machine</h2><p>Before Justin and Hailey quarantined in a lakeside home in Ontario, Canada in 2020, the couple were already hoping to sell off their newlywed love nest in Beverly Hills. The Biebs purchased the five-bedroom, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seven-bathroom home</a> in September 2018 for $8.5 million but took a $545K loss by selling it for $7.955 million.</p><p>Clearly, the Boyfriend singer was very eager to get rid of it, as he advertised the home on several occasions in 2019.</p><p>He posted <a href=#>Instagram</a> photos to attract buyers, including one with his two cats and his saggy pants, and another of himself sitting on the wooden stairs of an entertainment room. There’s a slushie machine and a foosball table, so we’re sold.</p><p>Unfortunately, his marketing tactics weren’t very effective because he only managed to sell it in February 2021, six months after buying his current home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-the-current-bieber-house-with-a-koi-pond>Inside the current Bieber house with a Koi pond</h2><p>After months of house hunting in 2020, the Biebers sized up to an 11,145 sqft home in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, a neighborhood that counts <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a> and Eddie Murphy as locals. Featuring seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, the property was originally listed for $27,250,000, but the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> paid $25.8 million in August 2020 – what a steal. The pair have expressed their eagerness to start a family, and we’re pretty sure this house is big enough for a Bieber brood.</p><p>Listed by Westside Estate Agency CEO Kurt Rappaport, the gated home is situated on over 2.5 acres. It was built in 1988, but the house was substantially upgraded in 2019 by its previous owner.</p><p>Standout features include a grand two-story entrance and gallery foyer. It’s the perfect home to entertain. Thanks to the home theater, infinity swimming pool, tennis court, and dining pergola. Let’s not forget about the outdoor pizza oven.</p><p>The previous owners brought some zen into the impressive home by installing a Koi pond.</p><p>The Biebers were represented by Million Dollar Listing stars Josh and Matt Altman</p><p>Hailey gave a tour of her renovated kitchen in November 2023:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2Z9cLXNrKCdnV2fwrTAyKdkmqaUYrWitcuesGaamZqvpr7SZpurnZGieq6tzaygqKZdrLa1tIyiq6xln6y7brHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1knZ2eZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenners-best-friend-stassie-goes-instagram-official-boyfriend-jaden-hossler-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner's best friend Stassie goes Instagram official with boyfriend Jaden Hossler</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./294305-printable-christmas-cards-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20 best printable Christmas cards to send to your loved ones</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
