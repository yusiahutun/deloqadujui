Her mother, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dame Olivia Newton-John</a> was born on September 26, 1948, in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Her family moved to Melbourne, Australia, when she was six years old. Newton-John’s music career started in 1966 when she released her first single, “Till You Say You’ll Be Mine.” She released her first album, If Not For You, in 1971. The album peaked at number 14 on the Australian album charts and 158 on the American album charts. Newton-John went on to release three more albums—Olivia, Let Me Be There and Long Live Love—before her breakout record, Have You Never Been Mellow, in 1975. The album became Newton-John’s first number one on the Billboard 200 charts and featured hit singles like “Have You Never Been Mellow” and “Please Mr. Please.” Newton-John went on to release a total of 26 albums throughout her career, including bestselling records like Clearly Love, Come on Over, Totally Hot and Physical, which featured Newton-John’s 1981 smash single of the same name.

Read on for what their relationship was like where Olivia Newton-John’s daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, is now.</p><h2>Who is Olivia Newton-John’s daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Olivia-Newton-John-1.jpg><p>Who is Olivia Newton-John’s daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi? Chloe is Newton-John’s daughter and only child with her ex-husband, Matt Lattanzi. Newton-John and Matt were married from 1984 to 1995. Newton-John married her second husband, John Easterling, in 2008. The two remained married until Newton-John’s death in 2022.</p><p>Chloe was 36 at the time of Newton-John’s death. She was born on January 17, 1986, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. Like her mother, Chloe is also a singer and actress. In 2002, she played the role of Chrissy in a Melbourne production of the 1967 musical, Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. She also co-wrote the song, “Can I Trust Your Arms,” from Newton-John’s 2005 album, Stronger Than Before. Chloe released her own debut single, “Wings and a Gun,” in 2010. Since then she’s released three more singles: “Play With Me” in 2011; “You Have to Believe” featuring Newton-John in 2015; and “Window in the Wall” in 2021. She released her first album, No Pain, in 2016. Along with her music and acting career—which also included roles in movies like Paradise Beach, A Christmas Romance,Bette, Dead 7 and Sharknado 5: Global Swarming—Chloe has also appeared on several reality TV shows, including as a contestant on Dancing With the Stars Australia in 2020 and singing competition Rock the Cradle in 2008.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Woman’s Day</a> in 2017, Chloe responded to rumors about the plastic surgery she had done. She explained that she had undergone two breast augmentations to correct a botched job when she was 18, as well as had fillers from her lips and face removed. “All those things were a disaster. Not only did the lip implants look ridiculous, the first boob op I had in Australia when I was 18 left me looking mutilated,” she said. “Now I’m a 32DD and I love my body and love showing my new boobs off. Mum supported my surgery decisions because she knew how unhappy I was before.” She also denied that she had any of her ribs removed to have a smaller waistline. “I’d never dream of removing a vital part of my anatomy,” she said. “I wear a waist trainer and work out to stay in shape.”</p><p>Chloe also opened up to Woman’s Day about her struggles with alcohol and cocaine addiction, which she was treated for in 2013. “I was using most days and nights. And not only was I doing coke, I was drinking vodka heavily also. I had to combine the two,” but now, the aspiring singer is much happier and healthier,” she said. “For anyone out there struggling with addiction. I feel you. Keep your sobriety. You never regret not drinking”</p><p>In an interview on the “A Life of Greatness” podcast in February 2021, Newton-John, who had several miscarriages before her daughter, revealed that she came “close to losing” Chloe before her birth.&nbsp;“I went to bed and asked God to save her, and if he did, I would say the Lord’s Prayer every night for the rest of my life,” she said at the time. “And so I have.”</p><p>Newton-John called the prayer “very powerful.” She was also asked on the podcast if she had ever “contemplated [her own] death” over the years. “I have quite a few times that it was a possibility sooner than I wanted it,” she said, referencing her 30-year battle with breast cancer. “We all know we are going to die. I think we spend our lives denying it. It’s extremely personal.”</p><p>She continued, “It’s almost like we are parts of the same computer and we go back to the main battery. I don’t have a definite definition of what it is. I think there is a great knowingness out there we become part of it.”</p><p>Two days before Newton-John’s death, Chloe took to her Instagram with a photo of her and her mother with the caption, “I worship this woman. My mother. My best friend. @therealonj 💋💕👯‍♀️” After her mother passed, Chloe posted a slideshow of photos of her and her mother throughout her life, as well as a video of them singing, “Window in the Wall.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Women’s Weekly</a> in 2019, Newton-John called rumors about her death at the time “greatly exaggerated.” “It can be upsetting, because you’re trying to heal and then people are kind of burying you,” she said. “I know it’s not the Australian public doing that. I know the Australian public loves me, and I feel it. I tell my friends, ‘Don’t believe what you read in the tabloids, unless you hear it from me.’ But still, there’s a constant cleaning up that you’ve got to do. I’ve accepted it. I don’t like it, but there’s no point getting too upset about it because that’s the business I’m in and I have such a blessed life.” Chloe, for her part, told Women’s Weekly about how the rumors upset her.&nbsp;“That made me so angry,” she said. “Because I’m protective of my mum. If you do think someone is sick, surely the decent thing to do is leave them alone.”</p><p>Chloe also told the magazine about how her parents’ divorce affected her. “My parents split up when I was about nine. It was tough. I don’t remember how I felt, but I remember one of my teachers taking me to the zoo and then taking me home. I think they were checking to see where I lived. I was a latchkey kid because Mum had to go to work,” she said. “It was unusual for a teacher to spend the afternoon with you, so she must have been concerned in some way, but I was fine. I was always a pretty happy kid, though I missed my dad and I could tell my mum was unhappy.” She continued, “We went from living in the university to a little apartment, and I would see my dad after school a couple of afternoons a week. That was hard. I remember sitting outside waiting for him. Then he left Melbourne and took a job in Newcastle, and I would go and visit him just twice a year.”</p><p>Newton-John also told Women’s Weekly about what it means to have Chloe after years of fertility struggles. “I’m sure I have re-enacted some of the things my mother did because you can’t help it – that’s in your DNA. It’s monkey see, monkey do,” she said. She continued, “When people ask me what is the most important thing that’s happened in my life, I say it was having her. Nothing compares to having a child. She is a young woman now, but those maternal feelings never change. So it’s been just an amazing gift. I wasn’t able to have any more, so she is ‘the lucky egg’, as her dad calls her.”</p><p>The mother and daughter also opened up about Chloe’s teenage years were difficult for them but they’ve come out stronger and closer. “I think the teenage years are difficult for everyone, and I think moms are afraid for their children,” Chloe said. Newton-John added, “Like Chloe and I, my teenage years were difficult for my mum – really difficult – but, when I look back, I can see that she was wise and firm and she did the right things.”</p><h2>How did Olivia Newton-John die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Olivia-Newton-John.jpeg><p>How did Olivia Newton-John die? Newton-John died at her ranch in Santa Ynez, California, on the morning of August 8, 2022. She was 73 years old. She was surrounded by friends and family, and passed away peacefully. Her husband, John Easterling, confirmed her death in an Instagram post on the day of her death. “Dame Olivia Newton-John (73) passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time.” the post read. “Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.

She got secondary infections. She really went down in the past five, six days.” Though Newton-John used medical cannabis to deal with the pain of her stage 4 breast cancer, Goldsmith told the news program that the drug didn’t help much toward the end of her life.&nbsp;“It wasn’t enough,” she said. “[She] really struggled with a lot of pain.” Goldsmith also recalled the last conversation she had with Newton-John before she died.&nbsp;“I told her all the things I needed to say,” she said. “She was leaving us, but I feel like she got it…She was really skinny and unwell and I said to her, ‘Are you afraid of dying?’ and she said, ‘I’m not afraid. I’ve done more in my life that I could have ever imagined.’”</p><p>Newton-John’s Grease co-star, Didi Conn, also told Good Morning America at the time that her late cast mate&nbsp; “wasn’t walking anymore and that she had full-time care” before her death. “Her husband, John, and her daughter, Chloe, were there all the time and she told me that they were just so hopelessly devoted,” she said.</p><p><span>Newton-John has one child, a daughter named Chloe Rose Lattanzi. She shares Chloe with ex-husband, Matt Lattanzi, whom she was married to from 1984 to 1995. Newton-John married her second husband, John Easterling, in 2008. They were married until her death in 2022.&nbsp;After Newton-John’s death, her </span>Grease<span> co-star, John Travolta, took to his Instagram with a tribute to his late cast mate. Travolta played Danny Zuko to Newton-John’s Sandy Olsson in 1978’s </span>Grease<span>. “My dearest Olivia, you made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again. Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever! Your Danny, your John,” Travolta captioned a throwback photo of Newton-John.</span></p><p>Newton-John’s cause of death hasn’t been confirmed, but a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> at the time of her death that she died of metastatic breast cancer. “After a 30-year cancer journey, she lost her battle to metastatic breast cancer,” the insider said. Newton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in August 1992 when she was 43 years old.&nbsp;“I draw strength from the millions of women who have faced this challenge successfully,” she said in a statement at the time. “This has been detected early because I’ve had regular examinations, so I encourage other women to do the same.”</p><p>Newton-John’s announcement came less than a day after she underwent a partial mastectomy of her right breast at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. “She’s doing just fine,” her representative, Sylvi Brown, said at the time.Newton-John declined to talk to reporters as she entered the hospital. “I’m just too upset to say anything,” she said at the time, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>. “I just want to get well.”</p><p>In May 2017, when she was 68 years old, Newton-John announced that her breast cancer had spread after doctors discovered that the cancer had metastasized to the sacrum, a bone at the base of her spine. Newton-John’s announcement came after she postponed the first half of her concert tour at the time due to severe back pain from what she believed was sciatica. Medical tests later discovered that the pain was due to her cancer. Olivia Newton-John is reluctantly postponing her June U.S. and Canadian concert tour dates. The back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour, has turned out to be breast cancer that has metastasized to the sacrum,” read a statement on Newton-John’s Facebook at the time. “In addition to natural wellness therapies, Olivia will complete a short course of photon radiation therapy and is confident she will be back later in the year, better than ever, to celebrate her shows.”</p><p>In her own statement, Newton-John explained that she decided on the treatment for her cancer based on the advice from her medical team at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in her hometown of Melbourne, Australia. She founded the center in 2008.</p><p>“I decided on my direction of therapies after consultation with my doctors and natural therapists and the medical team at my Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia,” she said. A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that Newton john hoped to return to her tour later that year. <span>“She plans to be touring in August. They’re all very positive,” the insider said.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Newton John’s first breast cancer diagnosis came after the death of her father, Brinley Newton-John, in 1992. The return of her cancer in 2013 came after the death of her older sister, Rona. Newton-John learned of her cancer’s returned after she was involved in a car accident.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> in 2020, Newton-John revealed that she had to learn how to walk again in 2018 after her cancer had spread so much that she had fractured the base of her spine. “I was so weak. I had a walker, a cane and crutches, but now I’m walking around,” she said. She told the publication that one way she kept her spirits up was by singing a song she created about her health. “I’m healthy, I’m strong,” she said. “I think it’s very important to keep that positive message in your head. You know, if you have a difficult moment, music is always a great healer.”</p><p>Newton-John also told the publication that she wasn’t surprised when her breast cancer returned in 2013. “It’s been a part of my life for so long. I felt something was wrong. It’s concerning when it comes back, but I thought: ‘I’ll get through it again,'” she said. Along with surgery, chemotherapy and radio therapy, Newton-John also credited medical cannabis—a drug she was introduced to by her husband, John, who grew the plant at their Southern California ranch as part of his business. Newton-John’s daughter Chloe also owned a marijuana farm in Oregon. “I was nervous of it in the beginning. But I could see the benefits once I started using it. It helps with anxiety, it helps with sleep, it helps with pain,” she said. Newton-John also denied that she was recommending medical cannabis as an alternative therapy for all cancer patients.&nbsp; “I’m not telling anyone to do anything,” she said. “I just want to do the research and find out which things work.”</p><p>Newton-John also told The Guardian about what she’s learned form her cancer diagnosis, as well as other experiences she’s had, such as her multiple miscarriages before she had her daughter, Chloe, and her ex-boyfriend, Patrick McDermott, who went missing in 2005 and was never found. “I’ve been through a lot of different experiences, some painful, some difficult,” she said. “As you get older, you grow some wisdom. You realise that you will get through this and you will survive it. Like the pandemic – these things happen, but life goes on. We will all learn and grow a lot from this. I think there’ll be positive things that come out of it.”</p><p class=dcr-139bh9t>She continued, “I don’t think of myself as sick with cancer. I choose not to see it as a fight either because I don’t like war. I don’t like fighting wherever it is – whether it’s outside or an actual war inside my body. I choose not to see it that way. I want to get my body healthy and back in balance. Part of that is your mental attitude to it. If you think: ‘Poor me,’ or ‘I’m sick,’ then you’re going to be sick.”</p><p>Newton-John also explained to The Guardian about why she doesn’t view her cancer, which led her to open the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre, as a “death sentence.” “I don’t know what I would be without it now,” she said. “I see it as my life’s journey. It gave me purpose and intention and taught me a lot about compassion. It has been a gift. I don’t wish it on anyone else. But for me, it’s been important in my life.” She also told the publication about why she’s no longer afraid of death. “Listen, I think every day is a blessing. You never know when your time is over; we all have a finite amount of time on this planet, and we just need to be grateful for that,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Olivia-Newton-John.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$14.95+</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$28.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>47% Off</span></p><p>For more about Olivia Newton-John, read her memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Don’t Stop Believin’</a>.
