meetings: Staff at Lady Katherine Leveson School in Solihull, West Midlands, watched Mrs Lockley coming into school with her two children</p><h3 class=wocc><b>VICTIMS OF 'SCHOOL-GATE' GOSSIP</b><br></h3><p><span>Lucy and Chris Mallows say they were accused of fabricating their daughter Josie’s autism as a result&nbsp; of school-gate gossip.</span><br></p><p><span>They faced an ‘extremely stressful’ two-week investigation by social services into claims of Münchausen’s Syndrome by Proxy.</span><br></p><p><span>When Josie started nursery at her Cheltenham school, the couple informed staff that she had been diagnosed with a form of autism.<br></span></p><p><span>But after staff said Josie was fine in nursery, mothers started talking, according to the couple,&nbsp; and rumours began to circulate that Lucy had invented Josie’s autism.</span><br></p><p><span>Worried, the head outlined her concerns in a secret letter to the Mallows’ GP, who passed it on to social services.<br></span></p><p><span>Lucy, 34, received a telephone call telling her that she and her husband, 35, were under investigation as the head believed Lucy was ‘seeking attention through the child’.<br></span></p><p><span>The case was dropped after the social worker concluded the allegations were baseless.</span><br></p><p><span>The Mallows are now moving&nbsp; to a different area.</span><br></p><p><span>Consultant paediatrician&nbsp; Dr Jo Jones, who diagnosed Josie as autistic, said: ‘The Mallows’ story is appalling.<br></span></p><p><span>The school’s concerns were based on a group of trouble-making mothers.’</span><br></p><p><span>The headteacher at the school declined to comment.</span></p><p><span>‘What I discovered horrified me,’ she said.</span></p><p><span>She learned that staff at Lady Katherine Leveson Church of England Primary School in Solihull secretly watched her coming into school with Sam and older daughter Laura, now 18, in a bid to prove their case.</span></p><p><span>They also held a secret meeting about her parenting skills during which ‘child protection issues’ were raised.</span></p><p><span>Mrs Lockley said: ‘I was gutted to find out what they had engaged in, which was basically a witch hunt. My world fell apart.’</span></p><p><span>She said that problems started when she tried to get Sam, who is now 12, assessed for special needs, only to be told he was fine.<br></span></p><p><span>During a six-year battle, she spent £10,000 on private medical reports proving that her son needed extra help, and £14,000 on lawyers to force Solihull Council to fund a place at a private school for autistic children. In 2010, she succeeded.</span></p><p><span>Carol Povey from the National Autistic Society said: ‘Many families across the country struggle to get a diagnosis of autism for their child, and report that local authorities and professionals can lack the&nbsp; necessary understanding of the lifelong developmental condition.<br></span></p><p><span>In some cases, this can lead to allegations of poor parenting, inappropriate care or even fabrication.</span></p><p><span>‘It’s vital that assessments are carried out by professionals who have an in-depth understanding of autism.’</span></p><p><span>A spokesman for Solihull&nbsp; Borough Council said: ‘We do not comment about the circumstances of individual cases.</span></p><p><span>‘Lady Katherine Leveson School has been contacted&nbsp; but does not wish to comment either.’</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FdoGTcW1wZ4Sdsm6%2FwqGmqKSjYsCxxYyGrKebmJbCtLHNZoSupaNioaatwqGcq6tdlrCkwdKeZKWxmaO0bq%2FHoqOdqpWjwG6t1K2grKVdlsG1sc2toKimXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-got-bandz-47698411.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Katie Got Bandz dating?
