Michael was best known for his series <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Architecture of Density</a> (2003-14), which focused on the facades of <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Hong Kong</a>’s landmark postwar tower blocks.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>These ominous concrete structures have none of the dazzling sheen of Hong Kong’s iconic harbour skyline, but rather reflect the difficult living conditions of the working class in one of the world’s densest cities. By cropping out the sky and occluding the horizon – a “no-exit” approach that he would use throughout his work – Wolf turned these buildings into seemingly infinite formal abstractions while inviting the viewer to reflect on the lives that they contain.</p><figure id=d926a14a-6245-473d-b66b-1a6f83c30aad data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Michael Wolf was regarded as an important voice on the phenomenon of global urbanisation.</span> Photograph: Flowers Gallery</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Hong Kong became Michael’s central photographic subject. In parallel to Architecture of Density, over the last 16 years he created a vast collection of images taken in the labyrinthine network of alleyways running between the city’s buildings. Entitled <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Informal Solutions</a>, in reference to the resourcefulness of those who frequented these spaces, this series documents the extraordinary vernacular life of the back alleys.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Using a typological approach, Michael photographed lost items of <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">laundry</a> caught on pipes, serpentine networks of ventilation ducts, mops, rubber gloves and umbrellas hung out to dry, twisted coat hangers, small improvised <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">shrines</a>, “bastard chairs” — the name he gave to the patched-up <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">seating arrangements</a> workers had devised — and combinations of all of these elements into what appear to be accidental sculptures.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>While his two major series focused on the city’s architecture in all its forms rather than its inhabitants, Michael was above all driven by an “extreme curiosity about people”. “I was always on the side of the underdog,” he said in 2014, in <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">an interview with the Los Angeles Review of Books</a>.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Over time, Michael became recognised as the foremost photographer of Hong Kong’s urban ecosystem. He was keenly aware of the documentary importance of his project and wanted his work to help preserve what he saw as a neglected facet of Hong Kong’s heritage. This commitment was met with surprise in some local circles as he had arrived as an outsider.</p><figure id=6e9e389e-fea5-4207-bb4b-59cfc403de4b data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Paris Rooftops, 2014, by Michael Wolf.</span> Photograph: Flowers Gallery</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Born in Munich, Michael soon emigrated with his parents to the US. He grew up in a creative environment, as his father and mother, Arne and Anna, both practised and taught art. He described himself as coming “from a politically active liberal family”, an engaged stance that remained central to his work both as a journalist and as an artist.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In 1972–73 he attended the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">University of California, Berkeley</a>, before returning to Germany to study under the photographer and teacher <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Otto Steinert</a>, the founder of the subjective photography movement, at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen. After graduating in 1976, Michael built a successful career as an independent photojournalist in Germany before moving to Hong Kong as a contract photographer for Stern magazine in 1994. He married Barbara Herrmann there three years later.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>While Hong Kong became his muse and the place where he established himself as an artist, he always aimed to expand beyond this territory, to deal with the issues raised by urbanisation on a global scale. Hong Kong provided him with a unique vantage point on neighbouring China, where he photographed his series Real Fake Art (2007) and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">The Real Toy Story</a> (2004), an immersive installation in which he integrated his portraits of workers in Chinese toy factories into a wall display made up of thousands of “Made in China” toys.</p><figure id=4cef1c6f-52ac-46fb-9abb-7bb3fb7122c5 data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>An image from the series My Favourite Thing, 2003-15, by Michael Wolf.</span> Photograph: Flowers Gallery</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>He also undertook projects in Europe and the US. In 2006, when visiting Chicago to install an exhibition, he was struck by the transparency of the city’s modernist architecture, made of glass and steel. This discovery led to the series <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Transparent City</a> (2006), which adopted a similar visual approach to Architecture of Density, but went beyond the buildings’ surfaces to examine the lives within.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>After Barbara accepted a post in <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Paris</a> in 2008, Michael began to divide his time between that city and Hong Kong. This move proved difficult for him, as the French capital’s Haussmannian architecture seemed impenetrable and frozen in time; unlike Hong Kong, it bore few signs of contemporary life.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Unable to find a way to photograph Paris, he resorted to exploring the streets using Google’s recently introduced Street View navigation. This opened up a fresh perspective on the city and allowed him to develop a new form of street photography based on crops made from behind his computer screen. He went on to use the Street View tool in a number of other projects.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Throughout his career the photobook played a central role in Michael’s work, particularly through the close relationship he forged with the Berlin-based publisher and bookseller Hannes Wanderer, who published under the Peperoni Books imprint and who died in 2018.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Together they produced 17 books between 2009 and 2018, including Tokyo Compression (2010), a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">claustrophobic</a> portrait series made in the Tokyo subway at rush hour in which the density of human bodies replaces that of architecture.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In 2017 his first retrospective, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Michael Wolf – Life in Cities</a>, opened at the Rencontres de la Photographie festival in Arles, before travelling to The Hague Museum of Photography, the Fondazione Stelline in Milan and the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg.</p><figure id=1a0a24ec-82c0-46f8-bc55-bf18a8609777 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>High-density megacities: the photographs of Michael WolfRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>While Michael had regularly exhibited his photographs since the mid-2000s, this was the first exhibition to bring all his major series together. Life in Cities revealed not only the extent of the visual archive he had built up in Hong Kong but also established him as an important voice on the phenomenon of global urbanisation.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The final series that Michael completed was Cheung Chau Sunrises. A departure from his previous work, its images were taken on Cheung Chau, a small, idyllic island six miles south-west of Hong Kong Island, where Michael had taken a flat to escape from the chaos of the city. These meditative, elated images of the sun rising over the sea were taken from his rooftop.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>He is survived by Barbara and their son, Jasper.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Michael Wolf, photographer, born 30 July 1954; died 25 April 2019</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJmiqa6vsMOeqqKfnmR%2FcX2YaKSasV9lf3C5yJyfmp2cYsSwuMVmppuhpKqus8U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./natalie-maines-dixie-chicks-bush-controversy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Remember When Natalie Maines Criticized the President?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-rober-19800311-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Rober (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
