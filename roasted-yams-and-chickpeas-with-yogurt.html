It’s cold and has been for some time. It’s cold and will be for some time. And somewhere out in California, a “friend” — but really, are they if they torture you so? — is welcoming their first strawberries. You get strawberries in New York, too, but for about 5 minutes every June and they cost about as much per square foot as real estate in a neighborhood with multiple pour-over coffee outlets.</p><p><span id=more-25717></span><br><a title="what you'll need" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1717/25261400092_2971c836ca_z.jpg alt="what you'll need" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="wedges with honey and two peppers" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1547/25286423741_763e2729aa_z.jpg alt="wedges with honey and two peppers" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>So, yes, February is the month. But this February? I never thought it would be the one. This is, by every measurement known, the mildest winter we’ve ever had, and the shortest too. I am, by almost every measurement I can invent, the most loyal and content New Yorker you’ll meet (but not the shortest, although close). But every night for the last week, I’ve pestered my husband with talk of Los Angeles, a mythical place where it’s warm and sunny all year round, where the tacos are unparalleled, where the avocados are exceptional, where you apparently don’t need to be a millionaire to have a home with more than two bedrooms. This is probably what happens to even the most stalwart New Yorker after too long without a vacation.</p><p><a title="seasoning the chickpeas" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1578/24752732233_606101ac4d_z.jpg alt="seasoning the chickpeas" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Fortunately, for times of great flux and inner turmoil, there are always cookbooks offering an escape. Like many a shivering East Coasters, I’ve been gazing lovingly over the <a href=#>Gjelina restaurant cookbook</a> this week, an understandable side-effect of cookbooks photographed by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott. That cover! Maybe I don’t even want to move to LA, I want to move into that cover, a tucked-in nest of fiery squash, protecting you from the slab concrete.</p><p><a title="roasted yam wedges" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1540/25379457535_6745b1f20b_z.jpg alt="roasted yam wedges" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>We should talk about the cooking too, and while it occasionally feels the tiniest bit formulaic, when that formula happens to be stunning gently charred vegetables, fish and meat, dabbed with something acidic (a yogurt sauce, bagna cauda, salsa verde and all of the other sauces I write across my heart), something rich (avocado, cheese, a bit of fruit), something fresh (herbs or another shaved vegetable) and something crunchy (seeds, nuts, crushed croutons, crispy onions, hiii ily), it is clearly in the service of greatness. I feel a responsibility to warn the home cook that sub-recipes abound (ocean trout rillettes has four; there are three within the rye rags with sausage, mushrooms and fennel that I’m going to make anyway because you read that title, didn’t you?) but there’s so much else in here for us — an enviable pizza section, a chickpea stew with tomato and turmeric I would swan dive into if I could — it would be a disservice to us to let this keep us away. The 30-deep vegetable section alone is worth the cover price; there isn’t a thing in there I don’t want to eat for the rest of my life.</p><p><a title="roasted yams and chickpeas with yogurt" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1524/25083845110_6812067c38_z.jpg alt="roasted yams and chickpeas with yogurt" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Because I’m back in the kind of place where I roast sweet potatoes all of the time for children <a href=#>tiny and mid-sized</a>, I was drawn to the yams first. They’re roasted in long wedges with a bit of honey, olive oil and a tremendous amount of pepper flakes (adjust to taste, of course) until singed and steak-like then drizzled with a sharp lime yogurt and thinly sliced scallions. For my purposes, I felt like I needed to add one more thing to make this more of a dinner centerpiece and that thing was chickpeas, roasted until crisp with smoked paprika and salt. My husband and I will unapologetically admit that we usually only eat sweet potatoes begrudgingly; they’re fine, but we mostly keep them around for the kids. Not this time. We didn’t even offer to share, just decimated the dish after they went to bed; my sole regret is having not doubled it so I’d have more left for today’s lunch.</p><p><a title="roasted yams and chickpeas with yogurt" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1636/24752731173_a861ffd107_z.jpg alt="roasted yams and chickpeas with yogurt" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>The ‘I Want Chocolate Cake’ Cake</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Morning Bread Pudding with Salted Caramel</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>French Onion Tart</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Fried Egg Sandwich with Bacon and Blue Cheese</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Piña Colada Cake</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Thick Chewy Granola Bars</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Hot Fudge Sauce</a> and <a href=#>Red Kidney Bean Curry</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Escarole and Orzo Soup with Meatballs</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Baked Tomato Sauce</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>Crispy Peach Cobbler</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Strawberries and Cream with Graham Crumbles</a><br><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Key Lime Pie Popsicles</a> and <a href=#>Butterscotch Pudding Popsicles</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Leek Chard and Corn Flatbread</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Zucchini Fritters</a></p><p><b>Roasted Yams and Chickpeas with Yogurt</b><br>Adapted from <a href=#>Gjelina</a></p><p>You’re going to end up with more yogurt and more chickpeas than you probably need — or fewer potatoes.
