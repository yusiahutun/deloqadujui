She was not allowed to go anywhere alone unless escorted by either church security, ethics staff, or a representative of Flag’s [Flag Service Organisation, a Scientology non-profit] President’s Office,” as quoted from Yahoo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Boniadi has never publicly spoke about her involvement with Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology.
