In his well-known 1981 study, “tear expert” Dr William Frey, a biochemist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, found that emotional tears – those shed in response to an emotion – contain stress hormones and other chemicals that build up in the body while we are under stress, and help to rid us of them. His research was published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Frey also noted that crying releases endorphins or “happy hormones” – chemicals produced by our brain that are thought to promote feelings of well-being – although Chan says more research is still needed to confirm this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/02/d6825376-7929-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_972x_154716.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another study found that crying might have a self-soothing effect because it activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps us relax. The results were presented in 2014 in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a 2008 study of more than 3,000 crying experiences, researchers at the University of South Florida found that most people feel better after a cry, and suggested that crying be used as therapy for people who have difficulty expressing their emotions. The research was shared in Current Directions in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/02/6d62055a-791d-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_972x_154716.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some schools, businesses and even government organisations are starting to recognise the benefits of a good cry. In January this year, police in Nottinghamshire in Britain opened “crying rooms” for its female officers and staff who were going through menopause and needed to let it all out (crying as a result of mood changes is often associated with menopause).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April, a “Cry Closet” was installed in the library of the University of Utah in the US. The small, white, closet-like enclosure was set up for students studying for their final exams and who needed a safe space to release their stress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/02/12979fce-792a-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_972x_154716.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/02/0615fc8c-792a-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_972x_154716.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yoga studios are generally considered places of calm, but many yogis admit to literally bawling while on the mat. While yoga helps to relieve stress, it can also trigger certain unexpected emotions, leaving some practitioners with tears streaming down their faces during or after a session.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As they work to understand and connect with themselves, it’s not unusual for my clients to cry during my yoga retreats and workshops,” says Uriel Yariv, a yoga teacher and co-founder and director of Mahasiddha Yoga in Chiang Mai, Thailand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/02/0367009a-7915-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_972x_154716.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As they connect with their bodies and emotions, they can’t help but allow the tears to fall,” Yariv says. “Crying helps them let go of their painful experiences, past traumas and tension. It’s therapeutic, and [after] they usually report feeling lighter and freer on the inside, stronger and more energised.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Cry if you have to, but you must also learn how to deal with the emotions that have triggered the crying in the first placeDr Jackie Chan</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Crying is surrounded by social stigma, with many associating it with weakness. Chan, however, says that if you feel emotional and want to cry, it is best to let it all out rather than holding it back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Crying can be helpful in some situations, but remember that it’s only a means for you to express your feelings, be it anger, sadness, anxiety, frustration or grief,” he says. “It doesn’t actually get to the root of whatever you’re feeling. So my advice is to cry if you have to, but you must also learn how to deal with the emotions that have triggered the crying in the first place and try to get in touch with them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While crying is also associated with vulnerability, Chan says there is nothing wrong with feeling or coming across as such; vulnerability, he explains, increases self-worth and invites you to be more honest with yourself. It also breeds intimacy with others and cultivates courage and compassion.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">For an antidote to stress, sink into a Hong Kong gong bath (no water required)</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course, crying can get out of hand. If you find yourself crying all the time or for no real reason, then it might indicate a serious underlying problem, such as depression.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Crying continuously because you feel helpless or overwhelmingly sad, or crying without knowing why you’re crying, is not healthy,” Chan says. “If this goes on for two weeks or longer, or if your crying episodes are interfering with some aspect of your life, like your job or relationships, then it might be a good idea to get professional help to work through those underlying emotions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmtobmtjbX5ww8eyZJyqqZ67qHnGqKadZamkwrN5x56YpayYYsGwu4ymrJygXZi8trjDZpmeZaOetK95w56cqZ2i</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./haunted-louisiana-home-free-brave-enough.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Haunted' Louisiana Home is Free to Anyone Brave Enough to Move It</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-chenoweth-all-about-new-husband-josh-bryant-wedding-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kristin Chenoweth's new younger husband Josh Bryant?
