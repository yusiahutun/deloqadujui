But while you may cringe at the core memory of your hair literally smoking as you used the hair straightener, the classic hair tool is far from a relic of the past. In fact, the best flat irons today have innovative features and use high-quality materials to better protect your hair from heat damage while giving you that sleek, frizz-free polish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, these inventive new features mean you’ve got a lot more to consider when buying a new hair straightener. Some flat irons are ideal for reducing frizz, while other hair straighteners are meant for curly hair. With the help of professional hair stylists, we tested 22 of the best hair straighteners from Dyson, Kristin Ess, Chi, and more. Here’s how each one performed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-straightener-overall-kristin-ess-3-in-one-flat-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Straightener Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kristin Ess 3-in-One Flat Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kristin Ess 3-in-One Flat Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TsxCsFOvkBMrtNWHAE6mRsASOzM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kristin-ess-3-in-one-flat-iron-fce29603d1904658a43168d4f61aeea9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With smooth titanium plates, a curved-edge design, and negative ion technology to reduce frizz, this versatile tool imparts shine and creates styles faster.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The temperature settings are a little confusing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">An excellent flat iron can straighten hair quickly, but this one goes a couple of steps further. Its use of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>negative ion technology</a> to combat frizz, along with its non-slip dual-titanium plates to keep hair in place while styling and overall lightweight feel earned it our title of best hair straightener.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We partially credit our healthier-looking hair to the lack of pressure we needed to use while moving the iron through our strands. Each pass from root to end was smooth sailing, which led to zero crimping, and the wider plates meant that we could work in larger sections to straighten and curl our hair in just one pass, reducing the amount of time we used heat. Meanwhile, the smooth curved edges glided through our hair as we curled it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the gorgeous white finish and gold accents give this tool an elevated, luxurious appearance, the design was uncomplicated — no learning curve needed; we could get right to it. The entire process was so straightforward, we could see this being a great tool for someone unfamiliar with curling their hair using a hair straightener.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, one button controls all four heat settings, which may sound tricky, but the clear LED screen on the handle flashed the settings as we changed them until we landed on our desired heat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a bonus, the device stayed true to its description and truly shut off automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity&nbsp; — leaving us worry-free if we did forget to unplug it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width: </strong>1.25-inch <strong>| Plate Material: </strong>Titanium<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>4<strong> | Temperature: </strong>280—440 F | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ion-magnesium-flat-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ion Magnesium Flat Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ion Magnesium Flat Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BT7txJJamNnXwbQV4bj_gsky9OM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ion-Magnesium-Flat-Iron-1-a15452f7880a49449e010a7caae75089.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sally Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The hair straightener glides through hair seamlessly and its silicone grip and swivel cord make it easy to maneuver and achieve any style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The clamp is a little loose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we wanted to exert the least amount of effort and see the highest payoff, the ion Magnesium Flat Iron gave us the best results. At an affordable price point, its design included everything we wanted from a hassle-free hot tool: It automatically turned off after 45 minutes, beeped when it reached our desired temperature, and thoughtful placement of the heat setting buttons, which are placed on the inside of the tool to avoid accidentally bumping the wrong one while we used it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the most part, we were able to run it through our hair without tangling in our strands, though we did notice minimal shedding when we used it on fine hair. However, across hair types 1C to 4B, the ceramic tourmaline plate evenly distributed heat to prevent a fried, crunchy look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These features, along with a swivel cord, that enabled us to easily reach all the way around our head, were especially beneficial when we used the narrow plates to work in small sections and create curls. A tighter clamp may have led us to see more defined curls on fine hair, but we were glad that it was loose enough to avoid clamp marks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tool also felt comfortable in our hands, courtesy of a slim design and silicone-textured handle, to give us a firm grip and it prevented our hands from burning on the hot iron.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width: </strong>1-inch <strong>| Plate Material: </strong>Ceramic tourmaline<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>4<strong> | Temperature: </strong>210—450 F | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flat-iron-for-thick-hair-hot-tools-pro-signature-steamstyler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flat Iron for Thick Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Signature SteamStyler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Pro Signature SteamStyler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WVmVIlO3gkCrh2eJdRChiHCFKyA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hot-Tools-Pro-Signature-SteamStyler-214dfb8c14d845e0bdfc19e24ced4b70.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The steam function helps prevent heat damage, managing to straighten even the curliest hair without causing harm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The design is a little bulky.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Far be it from us to complain about having <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thick hair</a>, but it can be a pain to style. Luckily, this Hot Tools flat iron gave us sleek, shiny tresses faster — and all while subjecting our hair to less heat than other hot tools. The steamer function styled our hair easily without leaving it with a fried, crunchy look. We were able to control the steam by placing it on a high or low setting, or turning it off when we just wanted to use one of the six heat settings without the addition of steam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the slim rectangular water reservoir means this design is a bit bulky, because it's located in the handle of the flat iron, it didn’t interfere with our styling or give our arms too much of a workout. Notably, we only had to fill the reservoir one time throughout the testing period, and we can imagine it will be a while before we need to do it again. To refill it, we unsnapped the reservoir from the hair straightener by pushing on a lever toward the end of the handle. Next, we turned it over, peeled back the rubber cap covering a large hole, and used the small included bottle to squeeze water (note that the brand recommends using distilled or spring water to prevent build-up) into it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Its 1.5-inch plates provided ample space for us to place large sections of our hair between the clamps and move from root to tip quickly — we only needed to run the iron through one or two times to see smooth strands for an overall fast styling session. One thing we noted is that we spent a little more time styling finer hair as it was more likely to slip through the plates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width:</strong> 1.5-inch<strong>&nbsp; | Plate Material: </strong>Ceramic<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Temperature</strong>: 300—450 F | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-dual-plate-salon-flat-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Flat Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Dual Plate Salon Flat Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pvBbxnTN7gf3yEKwVc6xN8nSmec=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-dual-plate-flat-iron-ab74af18cb9141549b5e812aab494eb1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With four plates, a wide range of heat settings, and a curved design, this tool is a master at straightening curly hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Using the dual-plated design requires a bit of a learning curve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since curly hair can be more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>prone to frizz</a> and, let’s face it, generally requires some extra maintenance to keep it in top shape, we sought a flat iron that would be gentle on our delicate coils while still giving us the straight look we want. This Hot Tools iron gets the job done: The smooth plates and curved edges seemed like they were designed just for our hair as the rounded surfaces made for bouncy curls, rather than sharp crimps we sometimes see in more rectangular options, and they swiftly tamed those pesky baby flyways close to our faces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And because our coils are so delicate, we appreciated the ability to adjust the temperature settings on each individual plate to mitigate how much heat we were applying. We found the most success by setting one plate at a lower degree than the other, so that we could prime the hair with just a little heat before the hotter second plate sealed in the style. Whether you have fine, medium, or thick hair, there’s a heat setting, 30, to be exact, to guide you toward your desired look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This technique isn’t totally intuitive&nbsp;— occasionally the dual plates creased our hair when we left it on a strand for too long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width: </strong>0.5-inch<strong> | Plate Material: </strong>Gold plated<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>30<strong> </strong>| <strong>Temperature</strong>: 300—450 F |<strong> Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flat-iron-for-natural-hair-tymo-ring-plus></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flat Iron for Natural Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tymo Ring Plus</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TYMO Ring Plus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oYzCvmQTNpY9ZavmCvxlHUm3tEE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tymo-ring-plus-312b211fad404d7c92e9a01d49428fd3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TYMO</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The flat iron gets hair straight in one pass without applying much heat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t have any curling capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The TYMO Ring Plus has a lot going for it: With an ergonomic design and cord that swiveled with our movements, we could get every one of our strands pin straight, even when we started on very wavy, curly hair.

Fortunately, we didn’t have to clamp down on our hair for more than a few seconds, so the heat isn’t applied for very long, and Chi also happens to make a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>top-notch heat protectant</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It took about an hour before the iron automatically shut off, and as added security, we liked that there was a locking mechanism to prevent the hot plates from touching other items while it cooled off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width: </strong>1-inch<strong> | Plate Material: </strong>Ceramic<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>5 | <strong>Temperature</strong>:<strong> </strong>370—450 F | <strong>Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flat-iron-for-fine-hair-t3-smooth-id-smart-straightening--styling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flat Iron for Fine Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>T3 Smooth ID</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="T3 Smooth ID Smart Straightening &amp;amp; Styling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HlX_LT3L0BrYYwNYor8FMrKgGnA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/T3-Smooth-ID-Smart-Straightening--Styling-Iron-07a2451829804a7a9438d7c6f861916b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With advanced heat technology and non-snagging ceramic plates, this iron protects fine hair as it straightens.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes time to learn how to curl hair using the flat iron’s extended rounded edges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Styling fine, thin hair can feel frustrating. Applying too much heat weakens already delicate strands. Not to mention, it’s disheartening when our hard-earned curls fall flat in an instant. Enter: The beautifully designed T3 Smooth ID Flat Iron, our pick for the best flat iron for fine hair. It gave our fine hair body, left us with long-lasting styles, and helped us maintain healthy hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It does a couple of things to achieve this. First, it harnesses an ion generator and patented CeraGloss-coated ceramic plates to boost shine and reduce frizz. (And unlike with other designs, we rarely saw our fine hair slip from the tool as we twisted and twirled it between the plates.) Next, the arms’ edges were slightly longer than the hot plates themselves, meaning our fingers had a place to safely rest (versus burning our fingertips, like other options) while we straightened our hair. However, they did cause a few pain points when we tried to curl our hair — the arms were so long that sometimes our hair wasn’t sitting on the hot part of the iron.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, the pièce de résistance of this smart tool was the technology — after evaluating our specific hair type and texture (including whether we colored our hair or not), it selected and heated to the perfect temperature to style our strands for a totally custom experience. From there, we never needed to re-enter our information — the iron remembered our unique settings and automatically heated up to that temperature with every use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However when we did find ourselves wanting to adjust the temperature ourselves, it was simple to unlock the screen and go back to the manual mode, where we could choose one of the nine temperature settings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width: </strong>1-inch<strong> | Plate Material: </strong>Ceramic<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>9 | <strong>Temperature</strong>: 260—410 F<strong> | Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hybrid-hair-straightener-dyson-airstrait-straightener></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hybrid Hair Straightener</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Airstrait Straightener</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Airstrait Straightener" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XZ-xcwobr_gt_a2RD58nrbYq20w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dyson-Airstrait-Straightener-9abb3c77107f4ae8ad30ade04dfeb328.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The Air Strait glided over different hair types with ease and fluidity — no tugging whatsoever.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The cord is big, bulky, and heavy, with the power center right in the middle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the newest innovations in hair styling technology comes courtesy of Dyson (naturally). The Air Strait isn’t a traditional hair straightener, per se, but it takes your hair from wet to dry by skipping the hot plates and using directed hair flow to dry and straighten simultaneously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Air Strait has all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a luxury Dyson flat iron-style tool: a bright LED screen, pre-set temperatures for wet and dry styling, and zero wait time for the tool to heat up. One of the highlights for us was noticing the pre-set wet styling temperatures (175 degrees, 230 degrees, and 285 degrees) were significantly lower than the temps for dry styling (250 degrees, 285 degrees, and Boost —&nbsp; which goes up to 320 degrees and is recommended only for touch-ups). We appreciated the preemptive defense against heat damage, and the settings were easy to adjust.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how easily the Air Strait slid over our hair; without any hot plates, there was virtually no tugging or pulling, further reducing the risk of hair damage. Even when we used the clamps to press down on our hair, there was no chance of our hair getting stuck in the hair straightener. Thanks to that fluidity, we found it incredibly easy to successfully straighten hair (although thicker hair needed a few more passes).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like many Dyson products, we were less than impressed with the bulky cord that ultimately weighed down the Air Strait. It was heavy, and our editor with Type 3B/3C hair had to take a break to give her arms a rest mid-way through using. We also imagine the thicker cord will make it hard to store this in space-constrained areas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate Width: </strong>1.6-inch<strong> | Plate Material: </strong>Copper alloy<strong> | Heat Settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Temperature</strong>: Up to 320 F<strong> | Automatic Shut Off: </strong>Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-39 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="A closeup of the buttons on the Dyson Airstrait Straightener" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ojjD3CnxHueo0UEvSKIS8AGnd_E=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-detail-dyson-airstrait-jthompson-0285-ff7a7107e8274ac39f05b4467fe19bde.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="The Dyson Airstrait Straightener sits on a blue countertop" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/E5Qnjob-30V0Gwv4D4OTFDRBBbk=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-product-dyson-airstrait-jthompson-0274-f41004bf79234db286bbb23042a30a76.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-fhi-heat-platform-tourmaline-ceramic-professional-styling-flat-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FHI Heat Platform Tourmaline Flat Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FHI HEAT Platform Tourmaline Ceramic Professional Styling Flat Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ALCGYkcHeKLl9cOT2Gd_08iUQiQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fhi-heat-platform-tourmaline-ceramic-professional-styling-flat-iron-6c7deb4388154a4592bd31807ccee2d9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a no-frills hair straightener that’s easy to use, thanks to its light weight and simple features.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The temperature can only be adjusted by dial, and it was often unclear what temperature we were on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re new to using hair straighteners or other hot tools, you won’t be intimidated by the FHI HEAT Platform flat iron we tested.

It slid through all hair types easily while straightening (although we felt a little tug while curling). The swivel cord was super long — up to 12 feet — and when purchasing this flat iron, you can choose from a few different width options to achieve your ideal look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This hair straightener did fall short for us with the temperature adjusting. The FHI flat iron uses a dial, and the designated markings are every 70 degrees. So, if you wanted to hit a 350-degree temperature, you’d have to make your best guess between 300 degrees and 370 degrees.

In general, LA-based hair stylist Laurabeth Cabott says that to preserve the health of your hair, all hair types should try to keep their hot tools below 365 degrees,Although she adds that for anyone with color-treated hair, stick to an even lower temp. “Anything over 360 degrees can strip your hair color, she says.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone with fine hair, celebrity hairstylist and founder of Deeper Than Hair Annagjid Kee Taylor recommends using a low setting between 250-300 degrees. “Fine hair is delicate and can be damaged easily, especially by heat, so using a lower heat will help prevent breakage over time,” she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have especially thick or heavy-bodied hair, celebrity hair artist Kieron Justin says you may need to bump it up to 450 degrees to see that pin-straight style.

The most common is ceramic. “It distributes heat evenly, reducing ‘hot spots’ which leads to damage,” says Kee. Always double check that your flat irons are fully ceramic, says Justin. “Ifthey are not, they can snag hair, causing split ends and dry or damaged hair,” he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, titanium plates are strong, protective, and typically made from“lightweight metal. This material“heats up very quickly and maintains a consistent temperature,” says Kee. As titanium can withstand extremely high heat, she tells us they’re a great choice for those more skilled at using hot tools or someone with curly or coarse hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you plan on using your iron every day or have fine or thin hair, tourmaline plates might be the best option as they are the most gentle, thanks to their semi-precious stone coating. Tourmaline“emits negative ions once it heats up,” says Kee, which prevents static and frizz, while increasing shine.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Styling Goals</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the best parts about flat irons is their incredible versatility.

Without a regular wipe down, build-up from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>heat protectants</a> and other styling products can impact the amount of heat that is transferred from the plates to your hair, meaning that even with a high temperature, you’ll need to do more passes to get the same result.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before cleaning, ensure the iron is turned off and has completely cooled down. Then, Kee recommends using a damp cloth with a bit of rubbing alcohol and carefully wiping down the plates to remove any debris. She also likes to dip a cotton swab into rubbing alcohol to clean the iron’s edges and crevices.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Don’t use any harsh or abrasive cleaning products as this can tarnish or damage the plates,” she says.
