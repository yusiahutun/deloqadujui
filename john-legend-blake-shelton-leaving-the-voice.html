The singer will miss Season 23 in 2023, ending a streak of seven consecutive seasons as coach. He'll need to say goodbye to the country singer a bit earlier than the rest of the cast and crew.</p><p>On Tuesday (Oct. 11), Shelton <a href=#>announced</a> that Season 23 would be his last. He's served as a coach for all 23 seasons, racking up eight wins. Next longest is Adam Levine with 16 seasons, then <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> with eight and then Legend, who says he understands why his co-worker is calling it quits.</p><p>"We're gonna miss him though," <a href=#>Legend tells ET.</a> "He's been the heart and soul and anchor of the show for a long time, and he's a friend of mine, and I really enjoy working with him."</p><p>Niall Horan and Chance the Rapper will be two new faces<a href=#> joining The Voice</a> during Season 23. Clarkson will also return after a one-season break. It sounds like Legend is open to returning at some point, too — an expanding family and touring commitments are the reasons why he's stepping away.</p><p>As for why Shelton is quitting, he says it's just time. In a post to social media, he thanked everyone associated with the show and the fans who watch. He also thanked the singers he coached and competed against since 2011.</p><p>"The show has changed my life in every way for the better and it will always feel like home to me," Shelton shared.</p><p>ET also reports that Shelton will turn his focus to music, touring and a new show called Barmageddon after he finishes The Voice. The show airs on Mondays and Tuesdays on NBC.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Blake Shelton's Winners From 'The Voice': Where Are They Now?</h2>How many of the eight Team Blake winners from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Voice</a> can you name? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Shelton</a> is the show's winningest coach, and several have had hits at country radio and beyond. Several more have shifted genres, changed their name or just flat-out gone missing. Here is the latest on every Team Blake winner from The Voice.<h2 class=photogallery-title>Famous Singers from The Voice, Then + Now</h2>Ten&nbsp;years (and counting) made a huge difference for many of the most popular singers and stars of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Voice</a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>&nbsp;looks noticeably different, but so do some of country music's most memorable performers.Winners like&nbsp;<a href=#>Cassadee Pope</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Danielle Bradbery</a>&nbsp;wore&nbsp;baby faces when they auditioned during their respective seasons.
