The longtime lovebirds have been married since 2005 and together, they created one beautiful family.</p><p>The <a href=#>Good Will Hunting</a> actor is very private when it comes to his life with Luciana, but he once revealed the story of how they met. While stopping by <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> in 2011, Matt said he happened to cross paths with Lucy at a bar in Miami at the time he was filming Stuck on You in 2003.</p><p>“We were supposed to shoot in Hawaii, and then the movie got moved to Miami … I had never really hung out in Miami,” he <a href=#>explained</a>, noting their chance encounter was especially unbelievable considering he didn’t even want to go out that night. Luckily, a crew member dragged him to the bar.</p><p>“I literally saw her across a crowded room,” he continued, noting Lucy was working as a bartender at the time. “Eight years and four kids later, that’s my life. I don’t know how else our paths would’ve crossed if that didn’t happen.”</p><p>Prior to meeting the Jason Bourne alum, Lucy lived in Argentina. The brunette beauty was raised primarily by her Italian grandparents after her mom and dad divorced, according to <a href=#>The Net Line</a>. While there’s little known about Lucy’s life before meeting Matt or when she moved to Miami, we do know she was previously married to ex-husband <strong>Arbello Barroso</strong>.</p><p><a href=#>Star</a> reported Lucy’s divorce from Arbello was finalized in December 2004. Before going their separate ways, however, the TV personality welcomed their <a href=#>daughter, Alexia</a>, in 1999.</p><p>Following her split from Arbello, Luciana and Matt tied the knot in 2005. After Matt adopted Alexia, the couple expanded their brood when daughter Isabella arrived in 2006, followed by Gia in 2008, and Stella in 2010.</p><p>Matt may have become one of Hollywood’s most iconic stars throughout the last few decades, but he and Luciana have never allowed the glitz and glamour to get between their family. In fact, the <a href=#>Academy Award</a> winner believes it’s a blessing that he “fell in love with a civilian.”</p><p>“I got lucky. Not an actress and not a famous actress at that. Because then the attention doesn’t double — it grows exponentially,” he told <a href=#>Esquire</a> in July 2013. “But I don’t really give them anything … they can try to stake me out, but they’re always going to get the same story — middle-aged married guy with four kids.”</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling to learn more about Luciana!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmK2sXZmurrvNrGSwoZaaeq3BwqKYp5ldl66zvs6spmallZrBbsDHnmSam6Skv7R5y6iloKyZorJuv8%2BorKydXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./roasted-yams-and-chickpeas-with-yogurt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>roasted yams and chickpeas withyogurt</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beef-neighbour-winding-me-up-parking-space.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ive got massive beef with my 50-year-old neighbour I dont know why he insists on winding me</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
