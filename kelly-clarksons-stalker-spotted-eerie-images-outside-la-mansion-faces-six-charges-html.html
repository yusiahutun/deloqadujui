failed to prevent the star from being targeted&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Young's stalking of Clarkson reportedly began over a decade ago, when she first tracked down the singer when she was living in Nashville.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The stalker then followed Clarkson out to Los Angeles, subjecting her to a string of bizarre encounters, including repeatedly showing up outside her home at exactly 8:59pm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Young has even been said to leave unwanted and odd gifts outside the Breakaway singer's property.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While forcing her family to cower inside at night to avoid the stalker, Clarkson's security chief has claimed Young has bizarrely attempted to gift items including&nbsp;dog toys, stickers, plants and seeds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier this month, Clarkson obtained a permanent restraining order against Young and another individual, named as Victor Fernandez, after they continued to appear outside her home and cause 'disturbances.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-ef42159225b10ee

who are now prohibited from contacting the singer and her two children,&nbsp;daughter River, 8, and son Remington, 6.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite the restraining order against her, Young was reportedly caught earlier this month <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>driving slowly past Clarkson's mansion four times in just 10 days</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to court documents obtained by TMZ, the singer requested the restraining order against Young after she showed up at her house at least 18 times since October.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The documents show Clarkson requested a judge keep Young 'at least a football field away' from her family, home, job and children's school.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite one of the singer's security guards previously confronting Young on one of her uninvited visits and warning he she was caught on camera trespassing, she continued to show up on numerous occasions.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The temporary restraining order was granted after Clarkson's security filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The stalker appears to be unable to stay away from Clarkson's lavish five-bedroom mansion, which comes complete with a series of luxury amenities.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It features a luxury spa, swimming pool, children's playground and tennis and basketball courts.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid
