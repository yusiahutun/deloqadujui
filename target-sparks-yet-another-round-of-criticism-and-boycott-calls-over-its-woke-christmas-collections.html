From the look of things, the top retailer might be in for some less-than-merry and likely busier-than-ever Christmas celebration.&nbsp;</p><p>Target started trouble for itself when it rolled out its Christmas range of decorative items. Notable among the items are toys of Santas representing various races, Pride Santa, Santa in wheelchairs, figurines draped in rainbow colors, same-sex couples, and Muslim families celebrating Christmas.&nbsp;</p><p>While many praise the company’s decision to be more inclusive this festive period, there has been a loud uproar over the retailer’s actions. Most of the angry crowd are conservatives who have branded the items as “woke” and “anti-christmas.”&nbsp;</p><p>Equally as loud as the criticisms are the repeated calls to boycott Target. Hashtags such as #BoycottTarget and #NotMyChristmas have spread across the internet alongside angry posts from customers. “This is just another example of Target trying to shove its liberal agenda down our throats,” read one comment from an X user.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#><strong>How Ellen DeGeneres’s Coming-out Episode Changed TV and Influenced Hollywood</strong></a></p><p>“I will not be shopping there. Haven’t for quite some time and certainly don’t plan to any time soon!&nbsp; You would think they would have learned by Bud Lights mistake,” said another user.&nbsp;</p><p>But there are also tweets in support of the company’s new direction. One such tweet read, “They should do something about those mean and aggressive Target clerks who are holding guns to the heads of those conservatives, forcing them to buy those things.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>POLL — </strong><a href=#><strong>Should Donald J. Trump Be Allowed to Run for Office?</strong></a></p><p>Another supportive post from Facebook read, “I think it’s great that Target is making an effort to be more inclusive.” “Conservatives need to get a life of their own and stop being jealous of other people enjoying living their “woke” life. Which, by the way, is hurting nobody,” read another X post.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, this wouldn’t be the first time the retailer would be making it into the black book of millions of its customers. Earlier this year, its Pride Month collections drew widespread backlash and boycotts from conservatives causing its revenues to tank significantly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#><strong>12 Countries With Strict Anti-LGBTQ+ Laws</strong></a></p><p>During this period Target admitted that its comparable sales fell by 5.4% in the second quarter ending July 29th. Its ECommerce sales also dropped by 10.5% during this time. However, the company was able to survive and managed to maintain a respectable profit margin by reducing inventory costs and cutting down on discounts.&nbsp;</p><p>Its ability to weather the storm earlier in the year is probably the source of the confidence behind the Christmas collection. Target has decided to double down on its inclusiveness policy, at the same time, during the right-wingers to do their worst.&nbsp;</p><p>A statement from the retailer to the press stated that Target is “proud to offer a wide variety of Christmas ornaments that reflect the diversity of our customers…We believe that everyone should feel welcome and celebrated during the holidays.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwaK%2Bxp6rZquglr%2Bsv4yynK1lkaO8tbTEq2Srp6WjsW67xWaaq6GknrCqv8xmmKecXZe8uq%2FOratmm5GhubR5zq%2Bcq2WZqcBuw86knGabmKe2tMDMmqpmm5%2Bhuaav06Kmp6tf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-animal-print-dresses.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 animal print dresses to go wild for this summer: From M&amp;amp;S to H&amp;amp;M, ASOS &amp;amp; more</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sneaky-women-share-shocking-reasons-lied-pregnant-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sneaky women share the shocking reasons they LIED about being pregnant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
