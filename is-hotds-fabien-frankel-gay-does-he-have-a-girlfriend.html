While the fans enjoyed the highly anticipated first episode, fans are eager to learn more about his dating life. Questions arose like is Fabien Frankel gay? If not who is his girlfriend?</p><p>Tag along with this article and learn more as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Fabien Frankel On House Of The Dragon</strong></h3><p>House Of The Dragon became the most anticipated and most viewed first episode in the history of TV. The prequel tells the tale of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Targaryen</a>&nbsp;civil war that took place 300 years before the original series.</p><p>Fabien Frankel is the actor who appeared in Ser Criston Cole, a dashing knight who rises to become a kingmaker. The Steward of Blackhaven’s Dornish common-born son, Ser Criston, arrives at King’s Landing with nothing except his swordsmanship. He will become considerably closer to young Rhaenyra as the season progresses.</p><p>“Rhys Ifans is the most electric person to have around,” Fabien said of one of his co-stars. “In scenes where you’re faced with a dragon, he makes you giggle. I’m like, ‘Please don’t look at me.’”</p><p>“He’s not what you think he’s going to be,” Fabien says about the character he is playing. “Over the course of the series, he changes a great deal.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Fabien Frankel Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Fabien Frankel allegedly owns under $1.5 million in net worth.</p><p>Before enrolling in the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, Fabian completed a one-year Foundation Course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He earned his Bachelor of Arts in Professional Acting in 2017. Shortly after graduating from theatre school, Fabian landed his first acting job as a professional.</p><p>Fabien appeared in the 2017 Charing Cross Theater in London production of The Knowledge. By the end of the year, Fabian had quit the program and had started a new career in film and television. He is bilingual, English and French, and trained in Advanced level 3 Single Sword Stage Combat (Examiner’s Gold Star award).</p><p>The actor’s on-screen work includes <a class=ng-binding href=#>Venice At Dawn</a> and the 2019 rom-com Last Christmas, which starred Game Of Thrones star Emilia Clarke. Fans are aware that Emilia is well-known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen, a Targargeyn ancestor who appears in House of the Dragon. In the movie Last Christmas, Emilia plays a Christmas store employee who develops feelings for Henry Golding’s enigmatic character.</p><p>Even though Fabien’s acting career is flourishing, he has expressed interest in working in the film industry. “I would really love to direct, ” Fabien told Variety. “I actually think that in some ways, I’m more meant to direct than I am to act.”</p><p>Besides the HOTD, he also starred in TV shows titled The Serpent and NYPD Blue. He is currently signed to a talent management agency called <a href=#>Curtis Brown</a>.</p><h3><strong>Is HOTD’s Fabien Frankel Gay?</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, HOTD Fabien Frankel’s sexuality is not clear. He hasn’t opened up about his sexual orientation yet. So, it is not clear whether the actor is straight or gay.</p><h3><strong>Does Fabien Frankel Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Fabien Frankel is relatively private about his dating life. The House Of The Dragon is a huge undertaking of the actor’s career and with that came the anticipated question “who is Fabien Frankel’s girlfriend?”. But of course, if you go through his social media, there isn’t much about his dating life.</p><p>Moreover, the paparazzi never caught him publicly with another woman, hence Fabien’s dating life is under wrap as of 2022. So, he is most likely single at the time of this writing.</p><p>However, Fabien had drawn the attention of fans with The Serpent co-star Jenna Coleman. Although they made a few public appearances, it turns out they were nothing more than co-stars and good friends.</p><h3><strong>Fabien Frankel Height</strong></h3><p>According to his IMDB, Fabien Frankel stands tall at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 meters).</p><h3><strong>Fabien Frankel Age</strong></h3><p>Fabien Frankel was born on 6 April 1994.
