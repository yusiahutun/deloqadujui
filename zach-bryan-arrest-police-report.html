The officer told him to get back in the car or he'd go to jail, to which <a href=#>TMZ</a> — who obtained the police report — reports he said, “I’ll go to jail, let’s do it.”</p><p>Once in handcuffs, Bryan&nbsp;remarked to officers actions like this were why people don’t like police. Later, he added, “This is the second time this has happened in three days. These f—ing cops are out of control” and “You boys need checked, a bunch of f—ing&nbsp;middle aged white dudes arresting people.”</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p>attachment-zach bryan mug shot</p><p>loading...</p></figure><p>At one point, Bryan started to apologize, but also said he’d get the mayor involved. He called his father to come retrieve his dog, and afterward police&nbsp;say&nbsp;Bryan's dad said the governor would put his finger on the arrest.</p><p>Ultimately,&nbsp;the country star was booked and charged with obstructing an investigation (the initial traffic stop of his bodyguard) and after a few hours, he was released.</p><p>"I was just an idiot and I'll take the fall for it. I'm a grown man and I shouldn't have behaved like that. And it won't happen again," he tells fans.</p><p>From there,&nbsp;Bryan continued his drive to watch his Philadelphia Eagles play football this weekend.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Stars and the Songs They Regret, Resent or Apologized For</h2><p>It's rare to hear a country star confess to hating a song they've recorded, but it has happened.
