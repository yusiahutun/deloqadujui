I would always tell people, ‘Watch, when I have a child I’m going to cook every meal for him and bake cookies every day,'” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said.</p><p>“Maybe subconsciously, I hoped my focus would just be on being a mother, and I looked forward to that idea. It felt like a relief. But what happens is that you find out you have to work.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Paris Hilton says that surrogacy was a ‘difficult decision’</a></p><p>This followed a tweet in 2019 where the Super Bass hit-maker <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced she was to retire</a> from music. The news upset fans (known as Barbz), however, she didn’t leave the entertainment industry after being told a story about mom guilt.</p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star said a story of a woman who felt motherly guilt both when she was a homemaker and worker made her realize that she “might as well continue doing the only thing I know how to freaking do, which is make music.”</p><p>Nicki added after becoming a mother in September 2020 she had “anxiety” about being a parent.</p><p>The singer said: “There’s no such thing as confidence in parenthood. I kind of wish that someone had told me—although I’m sure I wouldn’t have been able to understand it—that there’s a level of anxiety, and you think it’s going to go away, but in fact it gets scarier. So often you think: I don’t know how to do this!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-has-opened-up-about-having-parenthood-anxiety-before>She has opened up about having parenthood anxiety before</h2><p>Nicki previously <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> E! News when on tour, she would “struggle” with being away from her toddler.</p><p>The 41-year-old admitted: “I’m very attached to my son. I remember being in the UK and just bawling. And&nbsp;when I try to FaceTime him, I get more sad. So, I try to hold out on FaceTiming him because to then put the phone down is so difficult.</p><p>“I think moms feel like they have to be perfect. I hate that I have more anxiety now because you’re like, ‘What if the one time I leave my child, I get that phone call?'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-wants-more-children>Nicki wants more children</h2><p>Despite the anxiety and guilt she has felt, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said having siblings herself makes her want her three-year-old to also have brothers and sisters.</p><p>“I do want to have more,” she said.</p><p>“Not at this moment, but I don’t want to deprive my son of siblings. Having siblings, it causes you to have problem management skills early on in life. I would feel guilty if I didn’t give Papa Bear another sibling or two.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Margot Robbie and husband told to ‘get a room’ as he ‘pinches her bum’ on Red Carpet</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WFcLrInKKiZZ2eu6K2jLCYp6yVmXq1u4yrnK2hopp6p77OpmSmraOesG6yzqucr52iYq6nwMSrZKGZpp67qHnHnqlmq5%2BjeqPB02aaoZmenLKleceeqWalmaOxcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sofia-vergara-home-joe-manganiello-inside-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sofia Vergara's $10m home with Joe Manganiello is the epitome of luxury</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-fox-says-currently-seeking-girlfriend-shares-number-busty-selfies-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Fox says she is 'currently seeking a girlfriend' as she shares a number of VERY busty selfies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
