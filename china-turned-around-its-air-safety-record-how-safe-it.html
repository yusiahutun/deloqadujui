For example, it requires the CAAC to release a preliminary investigation report 30 days after an aircraft accident.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The overall accident rate of large commercial aircraft operating in China from 2008 to 2021 was also vastly below the global rate, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialist UN agency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, there were an average of 0.57 accidents worldwide and 0.69 among US planes per million commercial departures on planes heavier than 5.7 tonnes, ICAO figures show. There were no incidents involving Chinese commercial aircraft in this category in 2021.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">How common are aviation incidents in China?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Accidents and hijackings were much more common in the past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1980s, there were 17 incidents that threatened the safety of commercial passenger flights operated by Chinese carriers, according to data from the US-based Flight Safety Foundation. In the 1990s, there were 31 incidents, with over half of those being hijacks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But despite more flights operating in China in recent years amid growing demand for air travel, only 15 accidents were recorded in the 2000s and only eight occurred in the 2010s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rarity of major accidents, let alone fatal disasters, made the crash of China Eastern flight MU5735 – which killed 123 passengers and nine crew – all the more shocking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the deadliest aviation disaster in China since 1994, when all 160 people on China Northwest Airlines flight WH2303 died when the plane crashed after taking off because of a mechanical failure caused by poor maintenance.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Why did flights in China get safer?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China learned from fatal disasters in the 1990s and early 2000s, said Chrystal Zhang, an associate professor at RMIT University in Melbourne who studies Chinese aviation policies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Definitely the government had realised that safety should be the priority of the operation of the whole industry,” she said. “That kind of impact on the society, the confidence of people travelling and also the economic development, which was the goal of the government at the time, was negative.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Industry conditions also played a part, Zhang said. At the time, the airline sector was growing exponentially, resulting in a shortage of professionals – from pilots and air traffic controllers to mechanics – and training new blood would need time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In response to both the high-profile air disasters and competition for aviation professionals, authorities tightened approvals of new airlines at a time when low-cost carriers were piling into the market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the aviation community, people tend to talk about this dilemma that if you focus too much on the profit, you perhaps could overlook the safety requirements. That kind of tension always exists,” Zhang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the competition for domestic approvals as well as the need to compete with foreign carriers drove Chinese airlines to improve their safety measures, she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/01/e3a455e1-cfe6-4429-9c80-167905b8ef6c_eb3075b6.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What is China doing differently?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s so-called Big Three airlines that dominate the country’s airspace – Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines – are all state-owned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the CAAC, 69.3 per cent of transport turnover among Chinese carriers was from the three airline groups in 2019, the year before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. In 2020, they accounted for 68.2 per cent of turnover.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s cabinet, the State Council, oversees the three airlines, which Zhang said was good for ensuring operational safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike some civil aviation regulators of other countries, the CAAC both regulates the aviation market and oversees flight safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That kind of control, oversight and management is very well developed,” Zhang said, also noting that the CAAC’s structure, with seven regional administrations, made it effective in exercising its regulatory power.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NmhHODlnFmnKCZo65uwNSrpZ6cXZa%2FsMHNnWSirKNirqq%2BjKyYn52krnqzscKoqZ1lmKTEbr%2FAn5xmoaQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-d12aa650-2340-11e9-bca5-c73369175d13-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LPD Chief Stewart dies | News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-mind-blowing-facts-about-lee-byung-hun.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Mind-blowing Facts About Lee Byung-hun</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
