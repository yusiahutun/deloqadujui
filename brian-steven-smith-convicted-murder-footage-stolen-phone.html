The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>jury found him guilty</strong></a> of all 14 criminal counts he faced, including first- and second-degree murder, sexual assault and tampering with evidence.</p><p>Henry, the jury decided, was also subjected to "substantial physical torture," much of which was chronicled on video by Smith.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:94105273-a087-40f7-b8d7-b5625fb3ace7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:740bfaf8-ffd0-40f5-a781-a39fad1c6dfa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ff/5by4/2024/02/22/ff63893d802a41499a349bf909518172_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC 6/Miami-Dade District Attorney's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chilling Video Shows 13-Year-Old Murder Suspect Before and After Allegedly Stabbing Mother 46 Times</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The investigation into Smith began after a woman who reportedly met him for a "date" near Anchorage stole his phone from his truck after he left her alone to go get some money from an ATM. On the phone were 39 images and 12 videos showing Henry's murder.</p><p>The woman initially told police she found an SD card labeled "Homicide at midtown Marriott" on the ground in September 2019, before testifying she actually transferred the files from the phone to an SD card and later lost the original phone.</p><p>The video of Henry showed the woman being beaten and strangled at a Marriott, as a man with a South African accent said, "In my movies, everybody always dies. What are my followers going to think of me? People need to know when they are being serial-killed."</p><p>"You saw the defendant repeatedly strangle Kathleen Henry," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said Anchorage Deputy District Attorney Heather Nobrega</strong></a> during closing arguments. "You saw him step on her throat; you saw him step on her stomach. You see him fondle her and pinch her breasts. You see him poke her in the eye several times."</p><p>"'Just take it. You live, you die'" Nobrega recounted, quoting the convicted killer. "He's saying this as he's taking his hands on and off of her throat."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:146216bb-ae8c-4a8d-9b97-d94c12c2f109 data-container-ref=toofab:article:740bfaf8-ffd0-40f5-a781-a39fad1c6dfa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2c/5by4/2024/02/22/2c3b1e4664814f1aaf0c93e13947bc4d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Arrested In Grisly Murder of Pregnant Model Found Beaten & Bound Inside Refrigerator</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Though he wasn't seen in the footage, authorities recognized Smith's voice from a previous interaction. He was also registered at an Anchorage Marriott in early September -- matching the time stamp on the video -- and phone location data matched where he was seen dumping the body several days later.</p><p>According to DA Brittany Dunlop, Smith also admitted -- "with no prompting" -- that he had killed another woman while being interrogated about Henry. "He tells the troopers in the bathroom, 'I'm going to make you famous,'" said Dunlop, "He comes back in and says ... 'You guys got some more time? You want to keep talking?’ And then discloses this other murder."</p><p>The other murder was of Abouchuk, whose body had previously been found with a bullet in her skull. Per Nobrega, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Smith said he killed her because she "refused to shower."</strong></a></p><p>"It just pissed him off and he went to his garage and he got his gun and he shot her in the head," she said, adding that detectives were able to restore a deleted drive found at his home which included videos of Abouchuk before and after her death.</p><p>Smith pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, with his defense attorney arguing during the trial that his client confessed after "eight hours of pre-planned psychological warfare." Smith's lawyer also called the woman who found the videos an unreliable witness.</p><p>He faces life behind bars; his sentencing is set for July.</p><p>Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AP</strong></a>, Smith's wife said she intends to stay married to him, despite the conviction. "He was very good for me, but he had another life, I guess," she said, adding that she'll visit him in prison. "I said my vows," she concluded.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:916ef981-adf8-49bd-a856-aa04f77dff96 data-container-ref=toofab:article:740bfaf8-ffd0-40f5-a781-a39fad1c6dfa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a0/5by4/2024/02/21/a059d1bc568a4888bffca9e6a83eb6ce_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Montgomery County Jail/Polk County Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Family Friend Accused of Audrii Cunningham Murder, Sheriff Says He Participated in Search for Girl</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tma2tfl7%2Bqrc1mqq2dppq7br%2FMoquhZZOku7e1wq2cnWWdqr%2BlsdFmnainpJa0pnnSraalnZ5ivam7zZ5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billionaire-friend-no-jail-plea-deal-vegas-drug-case-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tech billionaire Henry Nicholas and his female friend pay $1 million in plea deal to avoid prison</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga-and-matthew-dada-williams.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga and Matthew &amp;quot;Dada&amp;quot; Williams</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
