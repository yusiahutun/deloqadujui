While it’s challenging to provide an exhaustive list of all the studies, but some key areas of research can be highlighted and explored to learn about the concepts and techniques involved in reprogramming the subconscious mind:</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading></h5><li><strong>Cognitive-behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> CBT is the most widely researched therapeutic approach. It pays emphasizes identifying and changing the negative patterns of thoughts and behaviors.
