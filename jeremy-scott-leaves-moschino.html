Still, the tone was strikingly joyful. “AFTER 10 YEARS I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT I WILL BE LEAVING MOSCHINO,” Scott wrote. “IVE HAD A BLAST CREATING DESIGNS THAT WILL LIVE ON FOREVER. I AM GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE LOVE AND SUPPORT IVE RECEIVED OVER THIS PAST DECADE. AS I CLOSE THIS CHAPTER I AM FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT & ANTICIPATION AND CANT WAIT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL WHAT I HAVE IN STORE FOR YOU NEXT !”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a press release following the announcement, Massimo Ferretti, chairman of Aeffe S.p.A, which owns Moschino, wrote, in a more subdued lowercase, “I am fortunate to have had the opportunity of working with the creative force that is Jeremy Scott. I would like to thank him for his 10 years of commitment to Franco Moschino’s legacy house and for ushering in a distinct and joyful vision that will forever be a part of Moschino history.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Under Scott, Moschino has become synonymous with camp. Actually, when the Met Gala theme in 2019 was “Camp: Notes on Fashion” and fashion observers were busy Googling the phrase camp style, their searches were answered with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181012132423-gettyimages-851074174.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a photo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a photo</a> of Scott backstage at his 2017 Moschino spring show, standing between a model covered in florals and another wearing a tutu and a tiny crown. As expected, plenty of celebrities wore the brand to the gala that year—perhaps none as famously as Katy Perry, who first appeared in a Moschino chandelier gown before changing into a Moschino hamburger costume for the after-party. (Other famous fans of the brand—and friends of the designer—include Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, and the Hadid sisters.)</p><img alt="new york, new york may 06 gwen stefani, bella hadid, stella maxwell, jeremy scott , katy perry, maluma, sarah paulson, tracee ellis ross, denek kania and violet chachki attend the 2019 met gala celebrating camp notes on fashion at metropolitan museum of art on may 06, 2019 in new york city photo by kevin tachmanmg19getty images for the met museumvogue" title="The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion - Cocktails" width=4368 height=2912 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1147459822-64188b5f2ef8d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Tachman/MG19</span><p>Jeremy Scott alongside the celebrities he dressed for the 2019 Met Gala, “Camp: Notes on Fashion.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s hard to imagine Moschino without Jeremy Scott, which is why so many fans online right now are lamenting his departure as the end of an era. Since taking over in October 2013, Scott carried on Franco Moschino’s legacy of satirizing the fashion industry with witty, pop art-inspired collections that remarked on consumerism and capitalism. Moschino, who always said he considered himself a “commentator” more than a designer, denounced the fashion excess of the ’80s with his take on Chanel suits with pinwheels for buttons and wide-brim hats made of airplanes. When he designed a T-shirt with a television tuned to “Channel No. 5,” he was actually sued by the house because of its reference to Chanel No. 5 perfume.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Years later, Scott would make his own spoof on Chanel for his first collection for Moschino in 2014: red and yellow skirt suits inspired by Ronald McDonald with flap bags reimagining the brand’s iconic heart design as McDonald’s golden arches. The fashion tide had shifted by then, with reviewers calling the collection “ingenious.” Karl Lagerfeld was a known fan, even saying in interviews that Scott might be the only designer who could take over Chanel after him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Instead, Scott went on to collaborate with Barbie, My Little Pony, and SpongeBob. Whereas plenty of brands have turned to gimmicks in recent years to go viral, his love of absurdity felt encoded into this aesthetic—and the brand’s DNA. The capacity to make a Hershey’s chocolate wrapper dress that has people thinking, “Yeah, that makes sense,” feels singular to Scott. No one does cheap and chic like him.</p><img alt="milan, italy february 20 designer jeremy scott and models walk the runway during moschino show as part of milan fashion week womenswear autumnwinter 2014 on february 20, 2014 in milan, italy photo by victor boykowireimage" title="Moschino - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Womenswear Autumn/Winter 2014" width=3500 height=2333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-470875619-64188ef8f2984.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Boyko</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Jeremy Scott with his models, following his debut show for Moschino in 2014.</p><img alt="milan, italy february 20 a model walks the runway during moschino show as part of milan fashion week womenswear autumnwinter 2014 on february 20, 2014 in milan, italy photo by victor boykowireimage" title="Moschino - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Womenswear Autumn/Winter 2014" width=2333 height=3500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-470875699-64188f099be83.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Boyko</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="milan, italy february 20 a model walks the runway at the moschino autumn winter 2014 fashion show during milan fashion week on february 20, 2014 in milan, italy photo by catwalkinggetty images" title="Moschino - Runway RTW - Fall 2014 - Milan Fashion Week" width=1997 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-479534239-64188f1a7cecf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Catwalking</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scott put his eponymous brand on hold in 2019, and fans are now wondering if he might use this time to revive it. His Instagram caption makes it sound like he has another project lined up, but still, it feels inconceivable to envision Scott at another brand or someone else at Moschino. For so many, Jeremy Scott IS Moschino.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“If you can not be elegant,” Moschino once said, “be at least extravagant.” If there’s anything we know for certain, it is that Scott will continue that legacy no matter what he does next. And we can only hope another king of kitsch takes over his reign.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
