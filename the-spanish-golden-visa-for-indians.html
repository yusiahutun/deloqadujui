Living in sunny Spain looks attractive. The government program participants must contribute to get the required type of permit within a few months. Thus, Indians have access to visa-free travel, a simplified tax system, and citizenship after 10 years of residence.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Overview of the Spanish Golden Visa for Indians:</h2><p>The system of obtaining a residence permit deserves high praise, as evidenced by its popularity. The modern <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spain Golden Visa</a> has many attractions that stimulate demand. An important aspect and motive for moving is that more than 70 thousand Indians live in the country. In this regard, immigration from India looks attractive and quite profitable. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1.-Overview-of-Spanish-Golden-Visa-Program-for-Indians.jpg><p>The description of the offer, which includes the system’s features, will help you learn more about the system:&nbsp;</p><li>Program terms and conditions. Only those Indians who have prepared documents according to the requirements can participate. The package includes a bank account statement, a valid passport, medical examination results, and insurance.&nbsp;</li><li>Requirements. The applicant is checked to determine his reliability. Thus, Indians with criminal records cannot apply for residency. In addition, these checks are required to determine the financial situation and health status.&nbsp;</li><li>Advantages. The application is considered within a few months. Personal presence is not always required for registration. Indians can use the services of accredited agents and lawyers.&nbsp;</li><p>Residence permits can be renewed to obtain citizenship after 10 years.

According to Vladlena Baranova, a specialist at Immigrant Invest, each of the proposals has its own advantages – the period of capital return, the possibility of sale, etc. Thus, Indians choose from the following ways:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><li>Bonds. Indians invest at least EUR 2 million in government-approved bonds.&nbsp;</li><li>Shares. Becoming a shareholder in a Spanish company is a profitable way to obtain a Spanish golden visa for Indians. The purchase of shares costs from 1 million euros. The government also provides a list of companies that obtain approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Real estate.

At the same time, you need to formalize the ownership at least 90 days before applying.&nbsp;</li><p>The payback period for investments is from 5 years. It depends on the investment method chosen and the company’s line of business.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Benefits of Spanish Residency for Indian Nationals:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.3.-Benefits-of-Spanish-Residency-for-Indian-Nationals.jpg><p>A resident of Spain gets access to the rights of the local population.
