His life was literally changed after his participation in the particular show. &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Born on January 25, 1999, in Campbell town, New South Wales,&nbsp;Australia, he attended Campbelltown performing Arts High School and left his schooling in 2014. Due to the separation of his mother and father, he grew up with his grandparents, Hannah and Roger Dow, and mother, Alana Dow. But it was his father who first imparted his courage to music. Fond of playing guitar, he himself learned it by watching videos on YouTube. After standing in the third position, he released his debut song "Your Eyes" which was an extremely hit song at that time ranked at number six on the ARIA Singles Chart. Thereafter his single "EP" also got ranked at number 21 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In February 2016, he became a part of the Australian soap Opera Neighbours as a character of Angus Beaumont-Hannay. He subsequently debuted in the episode which was premiered on May 2.</p><p style=text-align:justify>During the wonderful journey of X Factor, he sang songs like Drops of Jupiter, Somewhere Only We Know. Luckily, he got a golden chance to give the performance with Taylor Swift in her super hit song "We Are Never Getting Back Together". Throughout the journey in X Factor, he was compared with Canadian singer only to be told that he resembles with his idol, Justin Beiber, by fans later. He met him for the first time in December 2013. The talented young recording artist and the actor are yet to estimate his net worth. But we can assume his net worth might be more than thousand dollars. Being in the phase of focusing his career, he will surely earn a tremendous amount of money in upcoming years.</p><p style=text-align:justify>There's not much information on the internet regarding his personal life. But after stalking his Instagram, we found that he is dating the model and actress Carrington Durham. He is rumored to have affairs with Ashley Jones and his ex-girlfriend is Beunka Nunez . <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p style=text-align:justify>Active in social networking sites, he has millions of fans and followers. Even at the age of 17, he has earned the name, fame, success and even wealth. In his interview, he said that he loved performing live rather than recording. Standing in the height of 5 feet 5 inch, he has cute and charm face. Moreover, his bio can also be found in wiki sites.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZqOZmWLEorHTn6arnF2dsqqzx61koKGiobOztcSnm2ackam2r7OMp5ytZaekv7W0jaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-bieber-and-milyn-jenson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber and Milyn Jenson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ways-to-use-hashtags-on-tiktok.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>4 Ways to Use Hashtags on TikTok</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
