"As a Latino male, my intention was FAR from trying to be racist. I can't pull the 'I'm a person of color, I can't be racist' card. Racism has all sorts of forms and shapes."</p><p>He said he even went on Twitter trying to defend the artwork, but ended up accepting he can't tell people what to feel or think.</p><p>"As an artist I can only take the feedback and make sure I'm more careful with my choices. I am sorry if I offended anyone," he said. "At the end of the day, it's art and people are going to interpret it in the way they identify with it."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"My only question to those people is, how can you have an illustration that promotes the defunding of police, in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement, and also imagery of a Black person being lynched in the same picture?

Why would I throw that effort away with a racist drawing? There are people out here who really hate our teachers and seriously went out of their way to make something what it's not."</p><p>Mayor Lightfoot later claimed to have not even seen the image, only that it was described to her.</p><p>"If that kind of tweet, which is clearly racist, had been put forward by a right-wing group, we would rightly be denouncing them, and I think our scorn should be no less because it was put out by the CTU," the mayor said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1deba6b8-d7b4-423c-ba11-f912b7a52c63 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8a06a0f7-b710-43b3-9d01-7ef6c143fd4e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/83/5by4/2020/06/19/833c7f9998f74de898bc914519efadac_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Racist Reason White Cops Handed a Dying 14-Year-Old Back to Jeffrey Dahmer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Electricstripe found the claim she hadn't seen it laughable — almost as laughable as the description of the artwork the Mayor received.</p><p>"When the illustration was described to our mayor, (which I had no idea she was visually impaired to see it for herself) they were described as a group of 'unhappy white people, around a tied up black woman in rope'," he said. "You can already imagine what kind of image pops up into your head when you hear such description. They decided to only describe what was most convenient for them."</p><p>He said it took him a long time to figure out how the picture could even be perceived as racist.</p><p>"If people are going to try to find imagery in every piece of art instead of looking at the actual message, then sure, it’s racist to them. Lori agreed the image was racist, requested CTU to take it down and they did."</p><p>"However, we demand she take down a statue of Christopher Columbus, who if we're depicting its symbolism, stands for the looting, murdering and dare I say racist actions against the natives, that’s just simply a no-go from her end. You can't be out here being selective with racism only because it's convenient to you."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7e/4by3/2020/06/19/7e0d1e32a28b4b6785c909028d50ef5f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p>Despite the fallout over the meme, the Illinois native said he does not hate the Mayor.</p><p>"She was the queen of memes during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Props to her for engaging with us and having laughs with us," he said.</p><p>"With Lori Lightfoot, as our mayor, there are going to be things we'll agree and disagree with. We shouldn't have to be pushing her to make the right decisions."</p><p>He added: "I was never interested in politics too much in my youth. Now that we're older and seeing the injustices going on it's time for us to speak up and be more involved. I'm sure people will think I despise Lori. I don't. I am simply trying to remind her of what the people want."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:621dc9b0-e71a-4a4b-b274-3489c12ef7af data-container-ref=toofab:article:8a06a0f7-b710-43b3-9d01-7ef6c143fd4e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b1/5by4/2020/06/19/b1fc88f2b5ff442aa3e811ecf0e53e46_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Reddit</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Watch How Many Compton Deputies Pin This One Black Man To The Ground</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Lightfoot and the CTU have been at each other throats since they backed her rival Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 mayoral election.</p><p>"It's certainly disappointing when a group that professes to be educators, people who are in our classrooms teaching our young people, would engage in these kinds of really deeply offensive and disappointing tactics," she said in her original attack on the picture, calling for its removal.</p><p>"I don't think I need to say more than I think the scorn that they rightfully earned on Twitter with people being outraged and attacking them for stooping to such tactics.
