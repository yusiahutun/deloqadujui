Clayton’s eventual winner, Susie Evans, was eliminated in third place during Fantasy Suites after Clayton told her that he was in love and had sex with his other two finalists—Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey—and Susie questioned how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The fight escalated, and Clayton decided to eliminate Susie after she told him how she didn’t know if she could stay on the show if he was in love with other women.</p><p>At the final three Rose Ceremony with Rachel and Gabby, Clayton told both Rachel and Gabby that he was in love and had sex with both of them. Both Rachel and Gabby walk away and try to leave the show, which led Clayton to beg them to stay. Both Rachel and Gabby agreed to stay and Clayton gave them both roses. The finale continued with Gabby and Rachel meeting Clayton’s parents. After Gabby and Rachel’s meeting with Clayton’s parents, Clayton realized that he still had feelings for Susie and decided to talk to her. Host Jesse Palmer knocked on Susie’s door and told her that Clayton wanted to talk to her. Susie agreed and she and Clayton reunited. Susie then also met Clayton’s parents, after which he decided he wanted to choose her at the Final Rose Ceremony and eliminate Rachel and Gabby. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton arrived with an engagement ring and a plan to propose to Susie, but before he could do so, Susie told Clayton that was not in love with him and walked away, which forced Clayton to leave The Bachelor single.</p><p>During his “After the Final Rose” special in March 2022, Clayton revealed that he left the Final Rose ceremony to “what I thought was my normal life” until Susie contacted him to ask him to take her back. “I was absolutely shocked there was maybe that came from all of it,” Clayton said. Susie later came out during the special and confirmed that she and Clayton were back together and still dating. “We’re really happy and we’re happy to be here today,” she said. “That’s my boyfriend.” Susie confessed that she and Clayton “took some steps back,” but are currently in love. “I can confidently say yeah, he’s incredible,” she said.</p><p>Eight months later, Clayton and Susie announced their breakup.&nbsp;“With incredibly heavy hearts, we wanted to share that we have decided to go our separate ways. For anyone who has ever loved, knows this was a painful decision to make and not one taken lightly,” they said in a joint statement on their social media at the time. “We understand that there will likely be a lot of questions about this decision — social media is definitely a highlight reel and much of our experiences together we have kept private as I’m sure most can understand. But we will share this — although this last year together has brought us so much joy and so many laughs, there has also been a significant amount of pain.”</p><p>They continued, “We know no healthy relationship comes without its struggles, but we’ve realized that we were not prepared for the external forces that hindered our ability to not only heal as individuals but also as a couple.”</p><p>The couple told their followers that they were “focused on continuing to work on ourselves, so we can be the best version of ourselves” going forward. “This is not an easy time for either of us but we stand in support of each other and hope to see the other go on to find happiness and healing,” they said. “Although Claysie is no more, we hope that our communities can support us individually as we move forward with love and respect for each other.” They concluded their post “Thank you to all of you that supported our relationship. It means so much more than you will ever know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfnby4ecyapbJlkpawqbHLqKlmm5%2Bqva2x0maqraGcoXq1u8aeq6GdomQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spatial-sound-windows-sonic-for-headphones.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Enjoy Spatial Sound With Windows Sonic for Headphones</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./doctors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Doctors Archive - Page 3 of 11</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
