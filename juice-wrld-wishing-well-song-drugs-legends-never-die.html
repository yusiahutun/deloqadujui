However, one track that fans are buzzing about the most is “Wishing Well,” as it seems to have predicted the tragic fate that the rapper suffered when he died in Dec. 2019. Juice WRLD raps about his struggles with drug addiction on the song, which he recorded <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>before dying</a> from an accidental overdose.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Drugs killing me softly,&nbsp;<strong>Lauryn Hill</strong>,” Juice WRLD sings in the song’s chorus. “Sometimes I don’t know how to feel.” Other lyrics from the song include, “Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them” and “If it wasn’t for the pills I wouldn’t be here, but if I keep taking these pills, I won’t be here.” That last line really hit many fans hard, as Juice WRLD “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>died as a result</a> of oxycodone and codeine toxicity,” according to the Cook County Medical Examiner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/juice-wrld-new-track-7-months-death-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Juice WRLD had been open about his drug addiction before his death, but the lyrics in this new song are painfully honest. It’s a call for help that came too late, as the late rapper sings about going back and forth between wanting to start taking drugs again, and trying to hold out. The second verse concludes with him singing, “It’s tearing me to pieces, I really think I need them, I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Juice WRLD was just 21 years old when he died after overdosing on an airplane. When the plane landed, he suffered from a seizure. Officials administered Narcan, a medication which is meant to block the effect of opioids. Unfortunately, it was too late, and the young rapper was pronounced dead once he got to the hospital.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After Juice WRLD’s death, his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother spoke out</a> about the 21-year-old’s struggle with addiction, and how she hopes his message will help others who are also struggling. “Addition knows no boundaries and its impact goes beyond the person fighting it,” she said. “We hope the conversations he started in his music and his legacy will help others win their battles, as that is what he wanted more than anything.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH14e5BpZqOtmZiybsPRpZtmr5motaq6xmaunqScYsCwusZmm6utl6h6rbHGnqWdq12jsrex0Wabop1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ap-no-4-unc-dominant-in-rebounding-and-routs-florida-state-92-67-in-acc-tournament-quarterfinals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>No. 4 UNC dominant in rebounding and routs Florida State 92-67 in ACC Tournament quarterfinals</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-reveals-how-children-are-part-of-911.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Love Hewitt reveals sweet 9-1-1 detail with fans</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
