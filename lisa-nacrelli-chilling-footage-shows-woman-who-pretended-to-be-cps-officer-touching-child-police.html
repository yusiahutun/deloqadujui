On Tuesday, she was also charged with burglary and impersonating an officer.</p><p>According to mom Jaimie Spradlin, dad Tim and security footage from their home, Nacrelli approached their son while he played in their front yard. In the video, she can be seen running her fingers through his hair and putting her arm around the child, as Jaimie tended to her baby inside the house.</p><p>After a few minutes, the child can be seen telling Nacrelli, "You wait right here a minute. I have my mom," before going inside to get her. The woman didn't leave and instead waited for him to return, puffing on an e-cigarette while standing in the driveway. When Jaimie did step outside, Nacrelli said her name was Lisa and claimed to be from CPS, per local authorities. According to the Spradlins, Jaimie agreed to show the woman around their home, before she departed.</p><p>After looking into the woman, the family learned she was not from the agency and was an apparent impostor, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WCPO</strong></a>. The Norwood Police Department confirmed she was arrested two days after the incident.</p><p>According to a signed, hand-written affidavit (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX19</strong></a>), Nacrelli said she "had been drinking since I woke up that morning" and saw "a young child that I felt wasn't being supervised" while walking home from a trip to Kroger for more beer. "In an attempt to scare the parent I pretended to be from CPS," she added.</p><p>According to FOX19, police say she flashed a fraudulent child protective services badge.</p><p>The boy's parents, meanwhile, believe she had other motives.</p><p>"Your intention was clearly to take my son, to convince him to walk down the street with you to this house," said Jaimie, who claimed the woman "told my son that she has a black vehicle and that there's a really pretty car seat in it for him." The child's parents also claimed she asked him to go with her three different times.</p><p>Dad Tim Spradlin said he only saw what happened when watching the footage back later, describing Nacrelli's actions as "just rubbing my child" for 3-4 minutes. "We taught him Stranger Danger. He put his hands up and said I have to talk to my mom," he added while speaking with FOX19.</p><p>"It creeps us out a little bit, it's gut-wrenching," he also told WCPO, while his wife added, "I'm absolutely sick to my stomach."</p><p>Nacrelli appeared in court on Tuesday and entered a not guilty plea, shaking her head as the prosecution read the allegations against her. Her attorney advised her not to speak during the hearing and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>reportedly</strong></a> said her behavior could have been the result of a mental health episode.</p><p>Her bond was set to 10% of $10,000, meaning she could be released after paying $1,000. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hamilton County Sheriff's inmate search</strong></a>, she's still being held at Hamilton County Jail.</p><p>If convicted of Criminal Child Enticement, Nacrelli could face up to 180 days in jail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma2lfoba0rYynmJyqlaG5qnnCoaClpJmjtG6yzqirmp%2BVYsCpu9asZLCnnZa7bsPHqGSpqpWpsq%2BwxJ1kraddl7Jur8%2BsZKielp6wpr6Mraaum5ieu6h5wqGgpZxdpbyttcKeZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./princess-eugenie-new-appearance-pattern-clash-top.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Princess Eugenie wears incredible pattern-clash top as she makes important new appearance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bobby-smallwood-shooting-and-bobby-smallwood-legacy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>bobby smallwood shooting and bobby smallwood legacy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
