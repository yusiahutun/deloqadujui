Margaret is a supportive wife and mother of two wonderful kids. Let’s know precisely about her marriage, husband and children in our story.</p><h2>Wedding and Married to&nbsp;Journalist Husband:</h2><p>The author of bestselling book, “American Individualism: How A New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party," Margaret Hoover married John Phillips Avlon, the editor in chief of The Daily Beast and a CNN political analyst, in November 2009.

The elder son, Jack Avalon was born on 14 August 2013. The son was born at 7 pounds, 4 ounces and had the full head of hair.&nbsp; John shared about the childbirth to The Times via email on August 15. He wrote, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“A beautiful brave mother and proud papa are very happy to announce the arrival of one of the newest souls on the planet. Mother and baby are doing beautifully after the birth, which occurred at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York last night. We are thrilled and exhausted and feel thoroughly blessed. (He is) currently sporting a faux-hawk."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Following the birth, Margaret and John were showered with blessings and good wishes from their fans and well-wishers.
