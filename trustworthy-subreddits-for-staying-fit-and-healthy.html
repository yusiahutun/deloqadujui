This subreddit is arguably the most popular destination for Redditors pursuing their physical fitness goals. It has over 10 million members and is the 26th largest overall subreddit on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The great thing about using such a popular subreddit is that the posting rules enforced by moderators ensure content stays on topic and that members remain respectful and civil.</p><p>The subreddit also contains sections with static information that provides a foundational knowledge base. These sections include Muscle Building 101, Weight Loss 101, Workout Routines, and an FAQ dedicated to answering the most frequently asked questions on r/Fitness with the best, most given answers. If you have a question, it's probably been answered, so check here before posting.</p><p>To help you stay motivated on your physical fitness journey, r/Fitness features weekly threads that you can participate in, which include Victory Sunday, Training Tuesday, and even Self-Promotion Saturday. On Rant Wednesdays, you can post anything related to gym, fitness, or nutrition that has been frustrating you, like that person at your gym who refuses to wipe down the equipment after they use it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=r-fitmeals>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Fitmeals</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/healthy-plate.jpg><p>This subreddit is far less popular than r/Fitness, has a much lower subscriber count, and doesn't have as much saved content to browse through. However, what r/fitmeals does offer is a forum for fitness enthusiasts who cook their own food to discuss nutrition that can improve your physical fitness.</p><p>Each post can be tagged with a flair to let other members know what it's about, from a simple question to meals that are low-calorie, high-protein, or quick to prepare.</p><p>Say, for example, you've been hitting the gym hoping to gain lean muscle and are looking for an alternative to rice, broccoli, and chicken as your go-to clean, high-protein meal. You can visit r/fitmeals, filter posts using the High Protein flair, and see what other fitness fanatics are eating to learn something new.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=r-crossfit>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/CrossFit</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crossfit-battle-ropes.jpg><p>As the name suggests, this subreddit is dedicated to all things CrossFit—an exercise and weightlifting methodology focused on functional fitness. The subreddit includes discussion around not only CrossFit exercises but also nutrition and lifestyle. With over 600,000 members, it falls into the top 1% of most popular subreddits on Reddit by size.</p><p>Not everyone knows <a href=#>how to be a good Redditor</a>, which is why this subreddit's moderators and community rules ensure everyone has a good time and that the posts are of higher quality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is definitely the place to be if you're already into CrossFit since it includes details of upcoming events, and features plenty of discussions that you'll find interesting on topics such as the best stretches to improve shoulder mobility, how to train for cycling, and what tools work better to relieve DOMS—heat pads or massage guns?</p><h2 id=r-bodybuilding>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Bodybuilding</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bodybuilder-lifting-weights.jpg><p>With almost 3 million members, this subreddit is the premier place on Reddit to discuss everything related to ripping, pumping, and growing muscle fibers. You'll find news, articles, personal pictures, videos, and advice on bodybuilding here.</p><p>Members of this subreddit share detailed information about nutrition, supplementation, training techniques, and even contest preparation for those who wish to compete at that level of bodybuilding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like other popular subreddits, this one has its own set of rules. So, before posting a question, check if it has already been answered in the FAQ. This subreddit also includes a wiki, which is a collective effort of its members and a must-read for anyone who wants to post original content.</p><h2 id=r-nutrition>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Nutrition</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Freeze-Dried-Fruit-Mix.jpg><p>Another massively popular subreddit with over three million members, this is the place to be if you're looking to discuss nutrition from a scientific perspective. Topics you'll find people discussing include macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, diets, and nutrition news.</p><p>To maintain quality content and to ensure everyone has a good time, rules include no dietary activism or crusading, no requesting medical advice, and no self-promotion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recent discussions have covered topics such as whether carbs or proteins are better for breakfast, whether supplements are really helpful on top of a balanced diet, and the difference between macro and micronutrients.</p><p>Lending to its focus on nutritional science, the subreddit offers a template for members to use when sharing new scientific research related to nutrition. By including the author's name, the research institution, and the publishing journal, you can have some degree of confidence that the information being shared is not merely some random person's opinion.</p><h2 id=r-loseit>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/loseit</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/person-with-a-weighing-scale.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This subreddit boasts even more users than r/nutrition at nearly four million. This is the place to visit if you want to discuss healthy and sustainable weight loss methods.</p><p>Like r/Fitness, this subreddit has more than just posts. It also includes a static library of information that you can peruse to help get you started on your weight loss journey, including FAQs such as how to get motivated, whether you'll get loose skin and what to do about it, and how to get through a weight-loss plateau, among other topics.</p><p>The r/loseit subreddit is a great place to stay motivated because not only are other people pursuing the same goals and facing the same challenges as you, but also they are actively sharing their progress through things like 30-day challenges.</p><p>There are also weekly recurring threads such as Tantrum Tuesday, where you can share your complaints and vent about your journey, and Foodie Friday, where you can post your favorite meals and recipes.
