We're going to the dog groomers today, not just because he got really hot yesterday but I don't know if any of you have been struggling with this. We have been washing him, brushing him, but obviously our brush is not going deep enough and he's got all matted here, and he's got knots and things... almost like dreadlocks," she explained whilst Nick drove and Teddy sat quietly in the back seat.</p><p id=ey4TWWnrtXRa data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Andrea McLean transforms bedroom into beautiful home office</a></strong></p><p id=e_PhAi2pITq_ data-wc=23>"And so we managed to get an appointment with the dog groomers...

So it’s not me doing it this time. Poor little guy. He might not be fluffy for a while," the 50-year-old said, making reference to when she had to shave Nick's hair last month.</p><p id=eylShpHa_vOD data-wc=96>Later on, the mother-of-two shared a before and after picture, showing Teddy's incredible transformation. Captioning the pictures, she wrote: "He looks like a different dog!! Someone's happier (and cooler) now. I wasn't let loose with the clippers this time, Teddy was thankfully trimmed by lovely girls who know what they’re doing. Thank you dog groomers everywhere; it's one thing for us to have dodgy haircuts and nails during lockdown, but animals need their grooming for more than vanity. Is it wrong that I can’t wait for his 'shagginess' to grow back just a little? #doggytrim #dogsofinstagram."</p><p id=euvRSYv-mYIP data-wc=1><strong>SEE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Andrea McLean shares glimpse inside her living room – complete with family photos</a></strong></p><p id=eohiXaug3_gl data-wc=93>Andrea and her family welcomed Teddy to their family in November. Back then, the&nbsp;&nbsp;star shared the news on an Instagram story, telling the camera: "You may have noticed a little doggy pen in the corner there… we are fostering again! Yes, we are. Teddy! There he is. Teddy, say hi! Here he is. Hey Teddy! Smile! He's so cute. We have a slight problem with Teddy. We might not give him back. I know, technically we're fostering, but did you see him? What do we do? Do we keep him?"</p><p id=eUkIPESBZhcL data-wc=15>A few weeks later, the presenter announced that she and Nick had officially adopted Teddy.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
