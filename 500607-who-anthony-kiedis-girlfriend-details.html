Unfortunately, most of his relationships were short-lived. He has a son named Everly Bear Kiedis with Heather Christie. Here are some of his girlfriends:</p><h3>1. Marina Mazepa</h3><p class=align-left>In 2022, Anthony was seen dining out with Ukrainian actress, model, dancer, and contortionist Marina Mazepa. She is known for appearing on reality talent shows, including <i>America’s Got Talent</i> and <i>France’s Got Talent</i>, where she showcased her contortionist abilities.</p><p class=align-left>After dining out in Los Angeles in November 2022, the duo was spotted together in several other public settings. While there is no confirmation of whether Kiedis and Mazepa are dating, the tabloids and social media have speculated on a possible romantic relationship due to their frequent public appearances. Neither Kiedis nor Mazepa has made any public statements regarding the nature of their relationship.</p><h3>2. Helena Vestergaard</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6d3a3b8a9c2cef18.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Tina Turner?

The two were first seen together at a Lakers game in February 2013 and appeared in many public outings throughout their relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Kiedis and Vestergaard went to various fashion events, suggesting they enjoyed spending time together and shared an interest in fashion. Unfortunately, their relationship ended in late 2014. Despite its end, the relationship inspired much of Kiedis’ lyricism for&nbsp;The Getaway.</p><h3>3. Heather Christie</h3><p class=align-left>Anthony Kiedis was in a relationship with Heather Christie from 2004 to 2008. The duo welcomed their son <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Everly Bear Kiedis</a> on 2 October 2007. After their relationship, Anthony and Heather battled for the custody of Everly in 2018.</p><h3>4. Claire Essex</h3><p class=align-left>The Red Hot Chili Peppers lead singer had a relationship with Claire Essex, also known as Yohanna Logan, between 1998 and 2003.

While their relationship was marked by ups and downs, Kiedis cared deeply for Essex, and she profoundly impacted his life.</p><h3>5. Ione Skye</h3><p class=align-left>The singer was in a relationship with a British-American actress going by the name of Ione in the 1980s. He was in his mid-20s while the actress was under 18. The relationship was unconventional and, at times, difficult. As a result, the couple ended their relationship after two years of dating.</p><h3>6. Haya Handel</h3><p class=align-left>Anthony and Haya Handel had a relationship between 1979 and 1982. Haya is an Israeli-American actress best known for her roles in&nbsp;<i>Flashdance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Firstborn.</i> Their relationship was one of several high-profile romances that Kiedis had during that period.</p><h3>7. Heidi Klum</h3><p class=align-left>Anthony had a brief romantic relationship with Heidi Klum, a German and <a href=#>American model</a>, television host, producer, and businesswoman.
