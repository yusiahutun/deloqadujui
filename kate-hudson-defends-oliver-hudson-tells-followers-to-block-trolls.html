And then I really started thinking about it and I'm like, 'Well, people do care, actually,'" Kate told her followers on TikTok. "It's not nice when people take something out of context or they look at something you're doing and they get all negative about it, and they poke at it and they scrutinize it and they criticize it. And then I started thinking about people who live in that -- like myself or any kind of celebrity, where you kind of have to get used to it because people can be so mean -- you kind of get used to it. Then you kind of realize a lot of those people don't really exist."</p><p>Kate said she was baffled that people took time out of their day to call someone out online that they don't even know or be critical of someone's appearance from the comfort of their own home.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:df236ae7-8aa2-4add-83c4-9c5dbf9ada41 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3f4e060-5a86-4503-9820-13efb483afcc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/53/5by4/2024/03/25/5350a9ed09b44db990b046489f33b25e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Oliver Hudson Details 'Trauma' From Being Raised by Goldie Hawn</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She continued, "You go on and you're like, 'Who's this person being so mean to me on here?' And then you go on there and they have zero followers. And they have zero posts and you're like, 'Oh s--t , it's a finsta [fake Instagram account]' It's either a troll. They don't even exist, or someone's actually legitimately trying to make you feel or look bad. And then when you really break that down you're like, 'My god, the amount of energy it takes for someone to s--t on someone else is not only exhausting but not even worth giving any attention to.'"</p><p>Kate is not only aiming these words of advice to her brother, but to her followers as well, concluding that they should just "block" the haters.</p><p>"So, don't worry about it, and that's what I said to my brother, 'This doesn't matter. No one really cares and those who are writing that stuff and it's loud and it feels bad and you think it feels bad, just remember what I'm saying,'" she said. "These &nbsp;are not people you'd hang out with. These aren't people you break bread with. These aren't people who will enrich your life. So, just block 'em. block 'em. Block. Delete. Bye. And you know what, block anyone who talks s--t about anyone else, too...

Through the process, he learned his parents were only repeating behaviors they'd experienced.</p><p>"My mother was the one that I had almost the most trauma about interestingly enough because she was my primary caregiver and I was with her all of the time," he shared with guest Bode Miller at the time.</p><p>Oliver opened up about his childhood and detailed how she had boyfriends he didn't like and her busy work schedule left him feeling "unprotected at times."</p><p>Following the episode and its backlash, Oliver went on, what even the episode description described as "an apology tour after his casual comments were turned into clickbait."</p><a id=gallery-link-b2661746-4c99-4e81-99d3-743554979a0b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:b2661746-4c99-4e81-99d3-743554979a0b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3f4e060-5a86-4503-9820-13efb483afcc data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/4by3/2024/04/17/33355b6567b141e08ed788b8e3527d5c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mam9foK61sYyhrJ2rn6N6pbHFnqWdq12kuarCxKtkoa2UqLyvedOeo6WrXZu8rbjOsJyrq12pvG6uy6iapGWkp7ytuNJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sephora-belleza-coreana-mas-vendidos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>La belleza coreana que triunfa en Sephora</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bare-faced-cheeks-jeff-brazier-accidentally-posts-naked-video-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bare-faced cheeks: Jeff Brazier accidentally posts naked video</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
