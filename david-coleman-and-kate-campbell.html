It was totally a "Wayne's World" moment.<br>'Dream Weaver' started playing over the Real Sports sound system, everything was all of a sudden in slow motion, wind was blowing through Kate's hair, and I am certain that it took me a few minutes to pick my jaw off the ground.<br>Later in the night I had some time to talk to Kate alone and quickly realized that not only is she stunningly beautiful, funny, engaging, and a bad ass carpenter; she was profound, curious, intelligent and so much more.<br>I knew that I was in trouble! Especially because I was 45 km away from where I grew up and in a few days I was going to fly 3500 km away from the girl that I knew I had to marry.<br>So what does a guy do? Give your phone number, email address, home address, Facebook link, twitter handle, parents home number, parents cell, anything to make sure she can get in touch with you.<br>When none of that works gather some brand new fancy tools, put them in a fancy new tool box and write a hand written letter telling her how she is the most incredible girl you have ever met and that you cannot get her off of your mind.<br>And thus started our long distance relationship.<br>The rest of the story is very predictable and common; here are the highlights: Dave quits his job and drives across the country in a Uhaul with his brother Johnny, Dave and Kate move in together and start renovating a flip house that Kate purchased, while renovating the house top to bottom we agree to hike Mt. Kilimanjaro... So we trained for the hike in the morning, worked all day, renovated at night while planning a fund raiser event which saw 100 people, a whack of volunteers and $15,000.00 raised for clean water initiatives in Africa.<br>We successfully climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, finish the renovation, Kate sells the house and we live happily ever after... oh wait! Let's buy a house that was built in 1850 without a home inspection or any conditions, get engaged, change careers again, potentially have a show hosted by Kate documenting our renovation while planning a wedding, AND puppies, why not add puppies into the equation.<br>With all of this madness, I've never been happier in my life and could not be more excited about all of these wonderful adventures.<br>There isn't anything in this world that I would not take on without Katherine Leigh Campbell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZom5qumZl6pLvLnqSapl2Wu6V5ypqrnmWTlrqxrsSlow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-island-2017-camilla-thurlow-17050443.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love Island's Camilla drops innocent act in plunging nude gown</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./542256-ruben-studdards-net-worth-what-nowadays.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ruben Studdard's net worth now: What does he do nowadays?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
