The song delves into various themes, such as brotherhood, competition, admiration, and personal growth. Through these themes, West reflects on their journey together and the impact that Jay-Z has had on his own career.One standout line in the song is "Big brother was Big's brother." This line suggests the connection between Kanye and Jay-Z, emphasizing that their relationship goes beyond being colleagues or friends. It highlights the shared influence and mentorship Jay-Z had over both Kanye and the late Notorious B.I.G. This lyric develops the theme of brotherhood, not just in terms of blood relations but also in the music industry, where artists forge unique sibling-like bonds.Another significant line is "Now let the story begin." This line signifies a turning point in West's career, where he starts to rise and establish his own identity. It represents a sense of independence and personal growth, as he sets out to write his own story in the industry. This lyric develops the theme of personal growth and self-discovery, as West reflects on his journey from being mentored to becoming his own artist.The line "I guess big brother was thinking a little different, kept little brother at bay, at a distance" explores the theme of competition and envy. West realizes that Jay-Z, his mentor and idol, was not as supportive as he had hoped. It shows the complexities of their relationship, with Jay-Z trying to maintain his own success while potentially not fully recognizing West's talent. This theme of competition highlights the challenges artists face when navigating the music industry and trying to establish their own unique space.A particularly introspective line is "When I kick a flow, it was like pick and roll, 'cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give and go." Here, West reflects on their collaborative efforts and the dynamic of their relationship. Despite receiving opportunities and support from Jay-Z, West feels the need to prove himself and show that he can hold his own. This lyric explores the theme of self-validation and the desire to stand out and be acknowledged individually.The line "People never get the flowers while they could smell 'em" adds a touch of gratitude and appreciation. West expresses the importance of recognizing and admiring someone's impact while they are still alive and able to appreciate it.
