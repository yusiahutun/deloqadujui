Kanki's cynical view of the unification of China as a pretext for widespread violence and plundering sets the stage for a heated debate about the true nature of conquest. While Kanki argues that those advocating for unification are merely masking their desire for power behind noble ideals, Kyokai's revelation about Keisha's death adds another layer of complexity to the situation.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>With the Zhao army fortifying the central hill and containing news of Keisha's demise, the balance of power hangs in the balance.

However, the risk of triggering further conflict looms large in Kingdom Season 5 Episode 11.</p><h2 id=65fc4cc0a60ca>&nbsp;</h2><p><img alt="Kingdom [Yasuhisa Hara, Studio Pierrot, Crunchyroll]" title="Kingdom [Yasuhisa Hara, Studio Pierrot, Crunchyroll]" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-03/1711032655_kingdom-season-5.jpg></p><h2 id=65fc4cc0a60ce><strong>Kingdom Season 5 Episode 10 recap</strong></h2><p>Picking up where the previous episode left off, Kingdom Season 5 Episode 10 continues with Kinmou agreeing to Kisui’s request to keep Keisha’s death a secret.
