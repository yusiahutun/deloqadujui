The baker recorded a video explaining what happened to one of her orders, which, undeniably, has probably become one of her most memorable given the recipient.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-baker-katie-had-stressful-time-making-cake-for-taylor-swift>Baker Katie had ‘stressful time’ making cake for Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-02-at-14.28.37-1024x431.png><p>Katie says her cake even ended up in a Taylor Swift <a href=#>music</a> video, so it’s going to be remembered for years to come.</p><p>In her <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, she explains how the order came about: “I made desserts for Taylor Swift, and I had no idea it was for her.”</p><p>Apparently, a woman, who appeared “stressed” popped into her store a couple of years ago and was asking about particular desserts.</p><p>“She knew that she definitely wanted to place an order, but she needed more time,” Katie explains.</p><p>The shopper said she’d let her know in the next couple of days what she would need, but the baker was concerned it wasn’t a lot of time to get the job done.</p><p>But the woman did tell her it was for a “big <a href=#>celebrity</a>” and the cake would be used for a “music video production”, so she didn’t keep Katie in the dark – but she never thought in a million years it’d be Taylor Swift.</p><p>Fast-forward a couple of days, the order come sin, so Katie is stressing to make the deadline, luckily the cakes come out perfect. She forgot about the entire situation until receiving a random text message months later.</p><p>“Hey, by the way. [The cake] was for Taylor Swift,” and she shared a link to the music video, Katie says.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-can-t-believe-it>‘I can’t believe it’</h2><p>The baker admitted she “still can’t believe it” and thinks about the crazy situation to this very day.</p><p>But fans were suspicious because Katie didn’t explain what music video it was used in. They tried to deduce the answer themselves, coming up with either Blank Space or I Bet You Think About Me.</p><p>She made another video addressing claims she made the story up, and confirmed the Taylor Swift music video where Katie’s cake appeared.</p><p>Yes, it was the I Bet You Think About Me, at the point where Taylor is singing in a red dress at the wedding, and the tiered macarons are being doused with red paint.</p><p>She also admitted she couldn’t believe they pay so much money for a small part of the video. But a lot goes into making them, so props are quite important!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-02-at-14.30.18-1024x387.png><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2FcMDIpKuoo12Xrqyx0WaimqyZmnq0wNGeqqydlGK8tsCMm5yfp6Kaeqe1zZ2gp59dpMK1eceeqWabkaCybsPArGSfp6JiwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peggy-rowe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Peggy Rowe dating?
