Floor? Shining. Toilet? Sparkling. Shower walls and tub? Argh. That pesky buildup of black gunk and mold between the tiles and around the tub always seems to creep up, and getting rid of it, no matter how hard you scrub, can seem impossible. You may have heard that making a bleach paste out of baking soda and bleach for mold is the best way to remove it, but experts caution that it can do more harm to your grout than good. Luckily, thanks to a trend that’s gone viral on TikTok, YouTube and more, we discovered a genius solution to remove the mold between the bathroom tiles and leave your entire bathroom looking squeaky clean!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Baking soda and bleach for mold? Just say no</h2><p>It’s no secret that bleach and baking soda on their own are cleaning powerhouses, so it can seem natural to want to combine the two to tackle something as tough as shower tile mold. But as tempting as it may be, this combination of ingredients is discouraged by cleaning pros for a couple of reasons. “Bleach is a solution that can be very dangerous when mixed with certain elements, and bleach and baking soda together can be a corrosive pairing,” cautions Kathy Cohoon, operations manager at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Two Maids Cleaning</a>. “The combination can damage grout and floors and create an environment that is actually tough on your lungs!”</p><p>Luckily, there’s a simple hack to get the job done.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The viral combo that eliminates shower tile mold</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-591442970.jpg><p>Bleach is still a perfectly good option when it comes to killing bathroom mildew, and one product that contains it in particular can make the job a breeze.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathryn Snearly</a> of the YouTube channel&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Do It On a Dime</a>&nbsp;shares the two step combination that has taken social media by storm.</p><p><strong>Step one:</strong> Get yourself some Clorox Toilet Bowl Cleaner Clinging Bleach Gel (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Walgreens, $3.79</a>). “This product works great for two main reasons: the&nbsp;bleach&nbsp;is going to take care of any mold and mildew that has built up, and the&nbsp;clinging&nbsp;components are going to help keep it in place on the grout lines and on the walls of the shower while the active ingredients are working,” she shares.</p><p>A couple of caveats for cleaning success: First, make sure to test in an inconspicuous area first, to ensure the bleach doesn’t cause any unwanted discoloration. You’ll also want to make sure you have proper ventilation with a window open because of bleach’s strong odor.</p><p>Snearly also reiterates the importance of using the bleach product as is! “Make sure you’re not mixing it with any other cleaners or chemicals, as it can create some dangerous compounds when mixed.”</p><p><strong>Step two:</strong> All you have to do is carefully squirt the cleaner along the grout lines and in the bathtub. This can get a little messy, so Snearly recommends wearing gloves, casual clothes and even a face mask so you’re not inhaling the bleach.</p><p><strong>Step three:</strong> Once the cleaner is on the surface, gently press a few paper towels into the outer corners of the tub to help hold the product on the moldiest spots around the corners. “The paper towels I mention in the video below are really helpful for keeping the product in the right place,” says Snearly.</p><p>Not shown in her video but seen on other TikToks and YouTubes? You can line the walls with toilet paper (it’s thinner so it will stay put easier) to help the product stay on and stick in between the tiles as well. Simply press the paper onto the areas with cleaner and let it sit.</p><p>Snearly suggests letting the gel sit for 30 minutes to one hour. Then remove the paper towels, take a tile cleaning brush and scrub away the mold.</p><p>Give the tub and tile areas a good rinse with water from the&nbsp;shower head&nbsp;and it should be sparkling again with no sign of mold stains.

Scrub with a small cleaning brush or old toothbrush. Rinse the area well and repeat as needed.”</p><p>If the mold is covering a larger area, Cohoon recommends going with a spray instead. To do: combine 1 Tbs. of baking soda with some water in a spray bottle, then shake it until the baking soda is dispersed. Spray onto the tile surface and use a sponge or no-scratch scouring pad to rub at it. Wipe away with water to finish.</p><p>“Spray the solution on the surface one more time and let it dry to prevent future&nbsp;mold&nbsp;and mildew growth,” she adds.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>20 Brilliant Uses for Vinegar and Dish Soap —Clean the Entire House for Under $8!</a></p><p><strong>For more bathroom cleaning tips, keep reading!</strong></p><p><a href=#>4 All-Natural DIY Cleaners That Leave Your Toilet Sparkling — For Less</a></p><p><a href=#>Pro Housekeeper Calls This Simple Shower Tip the ‘Best Cleaning Hack of Your Life’</a></p><p><a href=#>5 Easy Bathroom Cleaning Hacks to Remove Mildew, Stop Soap Scum, and More</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomqWdkaO2r7OOm5ikoZ6cerS7w5pkmqaUYq%2BtscCcn2aen6d6rrvLnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chinese-parents-give-red-light-honest-sex-ed-textbooks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Honest primary school sex-education textbook in China slammed for going too far</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-use-anti-aging-skin-care.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where You Should Be Using Anti-Aging Skin Care (Besides Your Face)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
