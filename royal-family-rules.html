Yes, we’re talking about the royal family dress code. Because we couldn’t just waltz inside Kate Middleton’s closet or talk to a royal family stylist ourselves, we scrounged up seven rules (from U.K. sources like <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Sun</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>BBC</a>) that give us a glimpse into what the royal family is thinking when they walk into their closets every morning.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-royal-rules-and-dress-etiquette-you-didn-t-know-about>The Royal Rules and Dress Etiquette You Didn’t Know About</h2><p>From why you’ll see Meghan Markle in colored nail polish again after <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1743825/meghan-markle-american-riviera-orchard/>she stepped back</a> from her royal duties to the reason you’ll never catch Kate Middleton wearing shorts, here is your inside look to the royal family dress code.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.2361809045226><h2>No Colored Nail Polish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kate-middleton-hands.jpg><p>Unless you’re eagle-eyeing the royal family’s hands, you might not notice that the women are never spotted with colored nail polish. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>OK!&nbsp;magazine</a>, the royal family—particularly women like&nbsp;Kate Middleton,&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth, and formerly Meghan Markle—are prohibited from wearing non-natural-looking nail polish, which is why they often stick to nude and taupe colors.

But there actually might be a reason behind her extravagant fashion fixation. According to&nbsp;Diana Mather, a scholar of English etiquette, The Queen was frequently seen in hats because of an old tradition prohibiting women from showing their hair—thus the purpose of hats.</p><p>Though the rule is now clearly outdated (as proven with&nbsp;Kate Middleton‘s drool-worthy locks), The Queen—for the most part—still stayed true to it, choosing to wear hats for formal occasions.</p><p>“Up until the 1950s ladies were very seldom seen without a hat as it was not considered ‘the thing’ for ladies to show their hair in public,” Mather told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>. “But all that has changed and hats are now reserved for more formal occasions.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.9748743718593><h2>Why The Queen Always Wore Gloves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/queen-elizabeth-spice-girls.jpg><p>Once a fashionable accessory, gloves protected&nbsp;The Queen&nbsp;from germs and outside bacteria when shaking hands with dozens of people a day. (Yes, even the Spice Girls can hold nasty germs.) And while The Queen didn’t live in gloves (it really depends on who she’s meeting that day), you’ll be hard-pressed to see her at a public event without them.</p><p>“Let’s not forget she doesn’t always wear gloves when meeting people, therefore it depends on what she is wearing, where she is and what she is doing,” British etiquette expert Grant Harrold, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.9372384937238><h2>The Reason Prince George Is Only Seen in Shorts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Prince-George-of-Wales.jpg><p>Even in cold weather, you’ll see&nbsp;Prince George,&nbsp;Prince William&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kate Middleton‘s son, in shorts, and here’s why. According to a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sun</a>&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;William Hanson, a British etiquette consultant, pants on young boys are considered “suburban,” whereas shorts are indicators of a higher class.</p><p>Further, shorts also differentiate royal children from “men,” who are allowed to wear trousers without the same stigma. Hanson estimated that George will begin wearing pants at “seven or eight years old.”</p><p>According to Harrold, the rule comes from another rule in the 16th century permitting royal sons to only wear dresses and gowns until the age of 8. In the 20th century, the rule was amended to include shorts.&nbsp;“Thankfully in late 19th Century and early 20th Century this developed into shorts. This tradition is carried on by the Royal Family to this very day,” Harrold told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9839572192513><h2>Why The Queen Always Wore Bright-Colored Outfits in Public</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/meghan-markle-the-queen.png><p>Other than living life on the vibrant side, there’s a reason The Queen was frequently seen in bright-colored outfits. According to Harrold’s interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>BBC</a>, The Queen wore vibrant articles of clothing to stand out in crowds when she’s in public. The expert credits the move to The Queen’s personal assistant,&nbsp;Angela Kelley, who recommended bright colors to differentiate The Queen from commoners. After all, The Queen did reportedly say, “If I wore beige, nobody would know who I am.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.9779411764706><h2>Why You’ll Rarely See the Royals in Jeans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/harry-william.jpg><p>Though it’s more lax nowadays, there is a rule preventing the royals from wearing jeans—most of the time. According to Mather, there is a specific protocol for the royal family if they want to dress casual. Women are steered toward wearing day dresses or trousers with a jacket or cardigan, whereas men are recommended to wear chinos with a collared shirt or blazer. However, there are exceptions.</p><p>“Many places will not allow jeans as they are still seen as very casual wear, so it is better to play safe for both sexes,” Mather told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.&nbsp; “But if the duchess is outside walking the dogs for example, then jeans are fine.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.9815950920245><h2>When Kate Middleton Is Allowed to Wear a Crown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28.-Kate-Middleton-at-her-Royal-Wedding-to-Prince-William-1.png><p>You’ll be hard-pressed to find a picture of&nbsp;<strong>Kate Middleton</strong>&nbsp;wearing a crown before she was married, and there’s a reason why. According to Mather, crowns, tiaras, and the like are reserved for married women and members of the royal family. Harrold also adds that the headpiece also communicates to single men that tiara-wearing women are off limits.</p><p>“For married ladies it was a sign of status and would show you were taken and not looking for a husband,” Harrold told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.&nbsp;“For the gentleman it was a clear sign not to make advances toward the lady in question.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.47327044025157><h2>Why Royal Ladies Can't Be Bare-Legged</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kate-middleton.jpg><p>Dresses and skirts are a go-to for the Royal ladies, but they are not allowed to have bare legs <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>&nbsp;confirmed that the Queen expected all female family members and guests to keep their gams covered up in some type of tights.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7y6rctmnZqlmaHGbr7UpZysZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zachary-levi-agrees-pfizer-danger-to-world-antivaxx.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zachary Levi Says He Agrees That Pfizer Is a Danger to the World</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-there-u-go-by-2pac.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of There U Go by 2Pac</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
