She described a road trip the three took in the infancy of their relationship, during which Clark offered to shoot some photos of her and Peyton.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“We had kind of like some couple shots,” she told the Daily Beast. “[Clark] did kind of encourage more like romantic shots—I think mine and Peyton’s first kiss was on camera—I’m pretty sure it was directed, which was a little bit strange, but we all kind of bonded over the trip.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That same trip, Clark asked Kristine if she would be comfortable posing nude for him. She said she shied away from the idea and told him she used to self-harm and didn’t want to show her scars.

Peyton and I were sharing a room. Acacia and I would get into Melissa’s bed in the morning and just all chat together. We were very much like family. They were my only friends and my only family.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Clark continued encroaching on her, she said, having her pose nude for photos and sending her a number of explicit texts. “It was interesting, the dynamic between me and him, because it was like I was his assistant, I was his love interest, and I was his daughter,” she added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Daily Beast noted that they confirmed the phone number Kristine texted belongs to a number associated with Clark.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In another TikTok video, Kristine shows text exchanges she and Clark allegedly shared, including one in which he sends her a number of her photos and calls her ‘hot,’ which Kristine said was common.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In another exchange, Kristine says that she’s stressed out and Rich says that she needs is ‘endless sex with an older man.’ And in another, he fawned over pictures of another girl he was working with, who was around 15 or 16, and texted to Kristine, “She kept coming up to look at pics and pushing her boobs against me. Ughhh.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kristine added that she told the young girl’s parents about it, but did not elaborate on how or if the issue was resolved.</p><img id=i-32c14d9fec2d7ce3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/18/22/50674703-10218431-image-a-67_1637274794095.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Clark’s son Peyton, 27, starred on the Disney Channel series I Didn’t Do It in 2014" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Clark’s son Peyton, 27, starred on the Disney Channel series I Didn’t Do It in 2014</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the end of the video, Kristine says, ‘I can’t actually show a lot of the actually explicit photos that he took, but there are gross photos of me and his actual son. So dude’s a creep and I’m glad that chapter’s closed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eventually, Clark asked Kristine to be his ‘mistress,’ despite still being in a relationship with his son. “I told Peyton, I was like, ‘I don’t want to make a big deal out of this because it would make my life very uncomfortable, considering I live with you, but like do you want to handle it somehow, do you want to go talk to your dad,’” Kristine recalled to The Daily Beast.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kristine claimed that Peyton said that this wasn’t the first time a situation like that had happened. The two broke up in 2014 and Kristine told the rest of Clark’s family about the messages.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kristine said that Melissa was ‘justifiably horrified’ and kicked Clark out of the house. The two divorced later that year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After Kristine told Clark’s wife, he texted her ‘Nice work. Watch your back,’ to which she replied, ‘Threats Rich? Police will love this’ and he replied back, ‘No problem.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Records from Los Angeles Superior Court obtained by The Daily Beast show Melissa Dawson-Clark filed for divorce in May 2014, citing ‘irreconcilable differences that no amount of counseling could fix.’ The divorce was finalized that December.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The family was supportive of Krsitine months after she exposed Clark to them, but eventually kicked her out and distanced themselves when she began talking to other families and girls who worked with Clark.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said it was obvious that they didn’t want the family’s reputation damaged, adding, ‘their reputation really doesn’t hold a candle to these girls’ safety.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As this was happening, Kaia said in her YouTube video, she was going through her own battle to escape Clark’s grasp. She and Kristine both learned that the suggestive photos Clark took wound up on mature Instagram accounts and Kaia said she has documentation that her explicit photos were being sold online for as little as $2.58 for a 4x6 print.</p><img id=i-1567b49f48322edf src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/18/22/50674709-10218431-image-a-69_1637274817922.jpg height=793 width=634 alt="Clark's daughter Acacia Kersey, 24, amassed millions of followers on social media, starting on Tumblr before moving to YouTube, Instagram and now the artist-centric app Patreon." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Clark's daughter Acacia Kersey, 24, amassed millions of followers on social media, starting on Tumblr before moving to YouTube, Instagram and now the artist-centric app Patreon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kaia, now 23, described joining Clark’s modeling club after she moved with her mother to the Los Angeles area from South Carolina following her father’s death. But by her second photoshoot, he began pushing her to take more suggestive photos and telling her she needed to show up without her mother.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said, “He would start off with little things, and then gradually move toward more provocative images. He wouldn’t just be like, ‘Oh, do a pose,’ he would be like, ‘Lower your shirt a little, just above the nipple. Take your bra off. I can help you take your bra off.’ He would be very specific and detailed about what he wanted.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added, “He was very forward and pushy and creepy. He’s very odd… There was a time when we were doing a shoot and I was changing in the back of my car and I looked over and he jokingly stopped and took a picture of me while I was changing.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“I don’t know why he feels the need to photograph 16-year-olds in lingerie,’ Kaia continued. ‘If you didn’t have a strong backbone, he would definitely try and pressure you into doing things that you probably weren’t comfortable with.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An anonymous former client told the Daily Beast that Clark would text her periodically, once saying she had a “porn star body” and had mentioned she would be even “hotter” if she lost five pounds. She says she never worked with Clark again because she was so “creeped out” by his comments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kaia said her relationship with Clark ended after she found her photos online for sale and confronted Clark about it. “I came to Rich hysterically begging him to take them down,” she said, recalling how her high school classmates found the pictures online and bullied her over it.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/16/12/50552269-0-image-a-8_1637065766120.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>New Tory sleaze row over PPE deals as ex-Conservative...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/11/10/50346923-0-image-a-11_1636626704872.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Former Tory defence minister Philip Dunne under fire for...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kaia alleged that Clark lashed out at her and told her to never contact him again.
