That’s right, two decades since James Gandolfini’s character of Tony Soprano became legendary. But guess what? There’s one cast-member that actually hasn’t seen the show at all — Edie Falco.</p><p>Edie, 55, and other players from the iconic HBO show all got together on Wednesday, Jan. 9 at&nbsp;the SVA Theater in New York City for a special&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>20th anniversary panel discussion</a>. The actors took time to look back at the show that changed the landscape of gritty television dramas. But Edie probably can’t relate since she hasn’t watched yet. “I haven’t seen the show, actually,” the&nbsp;Nurse Jackie alum revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Extra</a>. “There are many, many episodes I haven’t seen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Edie-Falco-on-Sopranos.jpg><p>Edie also touched on just how strange it is to see all of her old co-stars again. “It’s completely surreal,” she told the outlet. “It’s just weird. It was so nice to see everybody and have a moment of like, ‘Oh, this is really weird!’ At least we can all be open about the fact that we all had a certain amount of trepidation about showing up. Like, what is this going to feel like, you know?” Edie added, “Many of these people I haven’t seen in 10, 15 years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Edie-Falco-Sopranos-Discussion.jpg><p>Edie, who played James’ on-screen wife on the series, was also recently part of a <a href=# rel=noopener>cast interview</a> on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Today</a>, and the actress was asked about her favorite scene with her TV husband. “First thing that comes to mind was there was a scene where he and I were in a lawn chair in the backyard by the pool,” she said.&nbsp;“It was tender, but it was&nbsp;Sopranos-esque in that it wasn’t, like, loving. It was just very, sort of, a day in the life of a long-term couple.”</p><p>Well, we think it’s only right that someone let Edie know where she can&nbsp;see the show that won her two <a href=# rel=noopener>Golden Globes</a>. Although, if someone has the DVD boxed set they can dust off, feel free to let her know, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46em6KdXZuura%2FOZp%2Baq56perSxxKdkraCVYsCwvNGapairXWd9bsXEmqmsZZyWwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dua-lipa-jennifer-lopez-metallic-bag-amazon-8640617.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez and Dua Lipa Have a Thing for This Metallic Bag Style</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./23-surprising-facts-about-tim-cappello.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>23 Surprising Facts About Tim Cappello</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
