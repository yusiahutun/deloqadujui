"The notion was Hefner raising his sons with his estranged wife living next door and him going to PTA meetings and helping his kids with their homework," he explained.</p><p>"When I proposed that to Mr. Hefner, he almost killed me," he added, saying Hefner told him, "This is the dumbest idea I've ever heard, no one would want to watch that show and I don't go to PTA meetings. What people want to see if my real life."</p><p>They filmed a 22-minute pilot called "Hef's World," but the decision was later made to focus in on the three main women in the Playboy creator's life and their lives in the mansion.</p><p>"I was 19 at the time, living at the mansion and one day we're in the limo with Hef and Hef goes, 'We might be filming a reality TV show, girls,'" recalled Kendra, who wasn't initially sold on the idea. "I'm like, what? No! No, I'm sorry, I'm not doing that. Just don't film us looking like skanks, I'll be good."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d282d1b3-eb8c-549b-9a0d-0f6b5690df25 data-container-ref=toofab:article:201b0814-3e01-44c6-836b-f1af7570ca0c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0e/5by4/2017/05/04/0e26d7c557645ede8742212207cc39fe_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Kendra Wilkinson on Vegas Gig, Feud With Holly Madison: 'I Have No More Hard Feelings' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>When cameras showed up at her door at 7am to shoot on the first day of filming, she had no idea what to do. "I have to take a s---, are you going to film me taking a s---?" she recalled telling the camera operators. "Like, what the f---?!"</p><p>The three women sold camaraderie on the show, but it wasn't like that at all when they stopped filming.</p><p>"On camera, you saw us together and it was the trio. Off camera, we would just disappear into our own little world," said Wilkinson. "We just never bonded. We were not friends."</p><p>Burns revealed just how cutthroat it got between them.</p><p>"Bridget, early on, would have a stopwatch and she would track how many screen minutes Kendra would get," he claimed. "I tried really hard to give each of the three girls equal time, but it drove them crazy that Kendra was the gift that kept on giving. Whenever you turned the camera on her, you were gonna get great television and the other girls felt they had to work harder for it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b9790740-bc00-5bc6-9b32-0728429561c5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:201b0814-3e01-44c6-836b-f1af7570ca0c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4e/5by4/2016/03/22/4e646890a4a8518487f52bd39f0edeca_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Holly Madison: Nothing Good Would Come from Meeting Up with Kendra Wilkinson</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The series spawned four different spinoffs; "Kendra," "Kendra on Top," "Holly's World" and "Bridget's Sexiest Beaches." Wilkinson's shows were clearly the most popular of the group, as her personal life with Hank Baskett continued to make headlines long after "The Girls Next Door" ended.</p><p>Kendra reflected on the demise of her marriage during the "For Real" special as well, after Baskett was caught having an affair.</p><p>"Reality happened. I was stuck, I didn't know what to do," she said. "I didn't know whether to turn the cameras off and run the other way or continue to do what I love to do. I'm very open and unfiltered, which is good for TV, but caused a lot of heartache and a lot of problems."</p><p>"Me and my ex husband have so much love for our kids, we chose to shut the cameras off during our divorce," she added. "We both had to do a lot of healing."</p><p>"For Real: The Story of Reality TV" airs Thursdays on E!</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c2f08032-23a7-5231-b192-39ba92041a74 data-container-ref=toofab:article:201b0814-3e01-44c6-836b-f1af7570ca0c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2018/06/05/37a79bfe15905f3ea6e1a115052671b3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kendra Wilkinson Live-Tweets Explosive Argument With Estranged Husband Hank Baskett</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2xma21foLKvsNGaZLChnKC2r7%2FOp2SgoaKhwG66xLGrZpyfpL9uss6rZKudkaF8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fleetwood-mac-mick-fleetwoods-daughters-humiliated-met-harry-styles-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mick Fleetwoods Daughters Were Humiliated When He Met Harry Styles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryshere-y-gray-parents-twin-dad-girlfriend-gay-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryshere Y.
