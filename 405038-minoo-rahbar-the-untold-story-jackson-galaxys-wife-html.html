Minoo has been bestowed many accolades for her exemplary cat works.</p><h2>Who is Minoo Rahbar?</h2><p class=align-left>Rhabar’s birth date falls on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">14th August</a>. Details of her birth year are unknown, but many speculate that the stunning cat devotee could be in her '40s. Many people assume she could be of Indian descent due to her distinctive Asian look.

Her <a href=#>family</a> reportedly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">escaped</a> from a war-torn country to America when she was ten years old. Rahbar’s family and early life details are discreet, possibly owing to a difficult childhood.</p><p class=align-left>Minoo attended high school at the US Grant School in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. She is an alumnus of the University of California in Berkley, where she graduated with a degree in anthropology. She’s also a fluent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Spanish orator</a>.</p><h2>Minoo Rahbar’s career</h2><p class=align-left>Her profession is best defined as an animal rescuer, precisely, cats. Minoo’s journey to humanity started way back when she would rescue stray cats and nurture them in her home until their recovery. Once the cats gained good health, she would take them to families willing to adopt them.</p><p class=align-left>Rahbar was awarded the <i>Kitten’s Rescue Award Advocacy</i> at the 4th Annual Furball event in Los Angeles for her prolific character. Currently, she manages the <i>Jackson Galaxy Solutions</i>, her husband's venture, which sells cat products.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e78cad8e0eb8181e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ashley Harlan: The untold story of Ben Roethlisberger's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jackson Galaxy’s wife, Rahbar, wears many hats.

She has been to Mexico as a volunteer in orphanages. Likewise, she travelled to Kenya, where she lived for a while and even married an Indian-Gujrati man. Her marriage to her ex-husband was, however, short-lived as the two separated for unknown reasons.</p><p class=align-left>It seems that Minoo had a successful relationship with her ex-husband father, Shuklal Himatram Mehta. The duo remained in constant communication with each other until the demise of Shuklal. Rahbar recently mentioned her previous marriage when sending <a href=#>condolences</a> to the family.</p><p class=align-left>Minoo Rahbar is currently in the US, where she lives with her husband and fellow cat buff, Jackson Galaxy.

Mooshka, their dog, was the couples' ring bearer. The couple cherishes their passion for each other and cats. As a result, they collaborate to continue saving cats.</p><p class=align-left>The duo is vegan, and Jackson cites that Rahbar has been an instrumental pillar towards his vegan journey and success. The couple does not have children but is fond of their fourteen pets; nine cats, three dogs, and two turtles.</p><p class=align-left>The phenomenal Minoo Rahbar is a fantastic philanthropist and the pillar of her husband's thriving <a href=#>business</a>.
