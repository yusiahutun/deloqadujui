"I remember another actress said something, actually. She was like, 'Well, I'm not in a dumb cheerleader movie' or something. Her saying that just made me feel so terrible about myself."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:908b2d80-5f0f-5483-81ed-f8ffd8728a70 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4196873a-9368-4635-a802-2047b3f9b771 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fa/5by4/2019/09/20/fa488a0f9b3d5deb9c96dc0b1e64ee75_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kirsten Dunst Slams Reuters' 'Pretty S----y' Tweet Calling Her Spider-Man's Girlfriend</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>“It's so funny how one thing can really -- it's not any of the good that sticks out, it's the one bad thing that really sticks out to you always," she continued. ['The Virgin Suicides' director Sofia Coppola] always says, 'Don't read anything because the one thing that's not good will be the only thing that's stuck in your head.'"</p><p>Dunst added that the film's success actually led to her being "a little embarrassed" with her friends as well, who she said would repeat lines to her like, "I'll get the door, Tor!" to her in real life when it was released.</p><p>"I was in high school, so I was kind of, I was the person in high school who kept my head down because I didn't want anyone to pick me out as the actress ... I really downplayed myself in high school," she added. "I definitely felt nervous at school, because I never wanted to be singled out for anything, I just wanted to feel normal, always."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:423a717c-7eda-48b9-b8a3-46e8e961711a data-container-ref=toofab:article:4196873a-9368-4635-a802-2047b3f9b771 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8d/5by4/2021/09/15/8d2a9ba285874a228087739ee45b33b7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gabrielle Union Says She Has Regrets About Bring It On: 'It Was a Mistake'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Dunst went on to say that the movie's success was "a complete surprise" to everyone involved at the time.</p><p>"It just goes to show you never know what's going to hit and resonate with people. I had no idea," she explained. "I don't have that perspective when I'm making it or even watching it. I watched it and was like, 'Oh, this is fun' and my brother was like, 'This is gonna be huge!' And I was like, 'Really, Christian?' He was like, 'Yes!'"</p><p>Dunst's interview coincides with her very first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, in celebration of her work in Jane Campion's "The Power of the Dog." Her real-life partner Jesse Plemons also stars in the film and earned a Best Supporting Actor nom himself.</p><p>We'll see whether they win when this year's awards go down Sunday, March 27 on ABC.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:afad5757-fa9f-4ed2-80e0-3c40b4c4041f data-container-ref=toofab:article:4196873a-9368-4635-a802-2047b3f9b771 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2022/02/08/6486ce00ae8f4bcfa77354e441e1a890_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">These Two Celebrity Couples Make Oscar Award History With Their Nominations</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2tmamlfoLazv9OepWacpaPAtXnBq6Cnn12ewW67zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./award-winning-producer-and-singer-babyface-signs-with-capitol-records.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Award-Winning Producer and Singer Babyface Signs with Capitol Records</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ciara-inala-hair-growth-power-potion-6741390.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ciara Uses Inalas Rice Water Serum for Hair Growth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
