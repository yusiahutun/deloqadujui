A quick swipe of color has the ability to make you look polished, even if it’s the only thing you have on your face. It shows people you made an effort —&nbsp;and it should make you feel like a million bucks.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As we get older and our faces evolve, it seems like lipstick becomes less of a finishing touch and more of an anxiety-provoking experience. Over time, our lips start to deflate, losing both volume and their natural color while gaining fine lines and wrinkles. Yet on the bright side, it’s clear from our experiments with different formulas and hues that the right lipstick can revive and refresh aging lips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-charlotte-tilbury-matte-revolution-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AkqkaTPzBBzwRCv70tMxJyO_Vqw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charlotte-tilbury-matte-revolution-lipstick-e3fb64ba2e7b4780b68f1c3a3930fe09.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charlotte Tilbury&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply taking this lipstick out of the box will hint to you that you’re in for a treat —&nbsp;the beautiful rose gold and retro-inspired fluted tube is like jewelry for your makeup bag. And what’s inside is even nicer: A lipstick with a uniquely sculpted tip that makes it easy to define the edges of your lips, especially if you’re not a big fan of lip liners.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the formula is described as matte, we’d call it more of a satin-matte hybrid, which is a good thing in our opinion —&nbsp;many of today’s mattes are ultra-flat, making dry or mature lips look dehydrated and crinkly. However, this one feels hydrating and silky, thanks to vitamin E and orchid extracts, while subtle luminous pigments create an optical plumpness without showing any sheen or sparkle. The soft texture fills in fine lines without calling attention to them or feathering with wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For many, the price may be a little steep, but it’s worth noting that the tubes have lasted us a long time, as do the formulas on our lips, though your mileage may vary. What’s been more disappointing is the fact that so many of the brand’s best shades have been limited edition. However, you’ll have no trouble finding the lineup’s most iconic hue, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pillow Talk</a> (a fave of Amal Clooney’s).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 17｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Orchid extract, vitamin E</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-paris-color-riche-les-nus-intense-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L’Oréal Paris Color Riche Les Nus Intense Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Loreal Paris Color Riche Les Nus Intense Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/763VsqzfgejRe06xloault9Ue6M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-paris-color-riche-les-nus-intense-lipstick--bdb3bed1cd05491090f010aedc427069.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re balking at the idea of shelling out over $30 for one of Charlotte Tilbury’s lipsticks, consider this collection from L’Oréal Paris. As an extension of the Color Riche line, Les Nus Intense offers a range of full-coverage neutral lipsticks across the color spectrum, from light peachy pinks to deep orange browns. They feel buttery and hydrating, courtesy of argan oil, making them especially comfy on dry, mature lips, but it may be hard for some to get past the scent, which is a strong floral aroma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 12｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Argan oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-chanel-rouge-allure-luminous-intense-lip-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Rouge Allure</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chanel Rouge Allure Luminous Intense Lip Colour " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/N-o76NKuIQYTE_DrI3lkO8XfhlE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chanel-rouge-allure-luminous-intense-lip-colour-4ec9baf11fc44f8989bf81ff0cafe4eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chanel</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Call this one love at first sight: You’ll be entranced by the lipstick’s packaging before you even get to the formula inside. When you tap the golden CCs at the bottom of the tube, the lipstick pops out (and securely locks back in with a satisfying click).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you might be reluctant to start using it so as not to mess up the bullet — it’s embossed with the brand name, another lovely hint of luxury — it’s worth it. The silky and very lightweight formula glides over lips to coat them with intense pigment in a range of sophisticated shades, including ultra-wearable neutrals and classic reds. Many of them are available in the nail color range, too, if coordination is your thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, the price may be on the steeper side, but it is Chanel, and the formula is as luxe as the brand name would imply it to be. Castor and coconut oils condition the lips, while a unique sappan wood extract soothes and comforts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to be aware of with these lipsticks is your shade selection —&nbsp;hues from seasonal collections don’t always get added to the permanent range, and it’s not always easy to tell which ones are limited edition and which aren’t. So, if you’re truly in love with one hue and you’re not sure if it’s sticking around, we suggest you buy a backup tube just in case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 24｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Coconut oil, castor oil, sappan wood extract</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-revlon-colorstay-satin-ink-liquid-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Revlon Liquid Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revlon ColorStay Satin Ink Liquid Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JUtEXzBthB7qn8gorLRCd9noA4s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revlon-colorstay-satin-ink-liquid-lipstick-b653a6821d6e440a9b40ce16b0d486fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason that this is the only liquid lipstick formula to make the cut on this list —&nbsp;this is one of the very, very rare few that doesn’t strip the lips, flake, crack, or feather. It features a high-shine finish in a comfortable, flexible texture and a shade range that includes everyday neutrals and “fashion” colors, like neon fuchsia and true orange.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, those who just dive into the tube and apply with abandon may not instantly like this product — the key to a successful application starts with wiping excess formula off the wand before applying thin coats and letting it fully set. With this technique, you’ll get up to 16 hours (!) of wear. Otherwise, the product will move and feel tacky on the lips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 20｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Black currant seed oil, vitamin E</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-contouring-hourglass-confession-ultra-slim-high-intensity-refillable-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Contouring</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hourglass Confession Ultra Slim High Intensity Refillable Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hourglass Confession Ultra Slim High Intensity Refillable Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J_3VzeGdA97gLF7NTNg6MGwVc48=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hourglass-confession-ultra-slim-high-intensity-refillable-lipstick--0ed6b84a808f4df39198aed0365795c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hourglass Cosmetics</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This lipstick’s elongated, slender, and refillable tube reminds us of the cigarette holders used in Old Hollywood, but more luxe —&nbsp;after all, this one is gold and houses a fabulous and creamy lipstick.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bullet is one of the narrowest we’ve ever seen, which is great not just for aesthetics but for function too — lip contouring requires a controlled application and this makes it a breeze.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The moisturizing formula comes in a delightful array of shades that won’t feather or smear. While the initial investment may be on the higher side, keep in mind that this tube is refillable, so once you’ve used up the first insert, subsequent purchases of your fave shade will be $24.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 40｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Sunflower seed oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-urban-decay-vice-hydrating-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Urban Decay Vice Hydrating Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Urban Decay Vice Hydrating Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DQwnDfVVEhWailagnqJ0Bj46334=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/urban-decay-vice-hydrating-lipstick-a0264b4ae77f480fa5e7623db7ab5758.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Urban Decay has been a favorite of ours for years. While we were wary when the brand discontinued its former lipstick formula in favor of this one, we’re big enough to admit when we’re wrong: This comfortable lipstick delivers the hydration of a balm in a lightweight, silky texture that’s a pleasure to apply.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The spread of shades includes some eye-popping brights, like the “punk pink” shade Hollyweird, as well as plenty of mauves, dusty pinks and taupes. Bonus: The mirrored sculpted tube feels great in the hand (and makes it easy to find in a dark purse).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are only two detractors, in our opinion: The formula does transfer, so if your date doesn’t like wearing your lipstick, save this one for another time, and the scent is fairly potent. However, we’d rather smell this base odor than a powerful fake fragrance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 35｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Aloe vera, avocado oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-matte-violette-fr-bisou-balm-sheer-matte-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Matte</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Violette Fr Bisou Balm Sheer Matte Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Violette Fr Bisou Balm Sheer Matte Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0fhoEcbosTZFCI6zlA9mI1XINCo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/violette-fr-bisou-balm-sheer-matte-lipstick-fe37aa4eccfb4f658cd19c83ae1eb697.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Violette Fr</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inspired by the French concept of bouche mordue, or “just bitten lips,” this quartet of matte lipstick shades offer an instant flush to the lips, creating a put-together look that goes with any makeup or outfit with a quick swipe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it’s matte, the lipstick’s velvety texture doesn’t enhance rough texture, but rather sits on top of the lips to deliver a sheer wash of color as well as light nourishment from rapeseed oil and pau d’arco. Using it is seriously foolproof — instead of creating harsh lines, Bisou Balm offers blurred edges that look effortless, not sloppy, regardless of which color you use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re partial to Bêtise, a warm mauve, but all the shades are beautiful.

It feels incredibly comfortable, even for all-day wear, while moisturizing jasmine wax and plum oil allow the formula to melt into lips, creating a glaze-like finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As you might imagine, like most shiny formulas, this one doesn’t offer longwear benefits — you’ll get about four hours at most. However, the tubes are refillable, which does defray some cost overtime, and for an added fee, you can also get a “couture lipstick case” in the brand’s signature cannage (a pink patent leather-like tube with the stitching you’d see on Lady Dior bags) or ‘00s denim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 25｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Jasmine wax, plum oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-gloss-tarte-maracuja-juicy-lip-plump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Gloss</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Gc9mEYCbUt_IcocuTp7xpEBqghg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-80d486529ce746e2a5987e2a856cb700.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been hooked on this formula since we first tried it, due to its super soft texture and sheer, lip-enhancing shades. It’s loaded with nourishing oils and fruit extracts that help boost collagen, seal in moisture, and fight signs of aging. The high sheen finish and cream base smooth out fine lines while adding major dimension to lips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Be careful with this one in warmer weather, though —&nbsp;the very, very soft bullet gets even softer in high temps and may deposit chunks of pigment or even snap off.

Once they’re on, they’re on — you can expect to get a full day of even wear out of this lipstick, so long as you don’t consume overly greasy foods, which can cause the pigment to break down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we admit it’s not aggressively drying like many matte formulas we’ve tried, don’t look for it to even slightly moisturize or hydrate. Still, it won’t exacerbate the look of lines or feather like others do, so if you can handle a little dryness in exchange for a killer red, Forbidden Love is worth a try.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 34｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Squalane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pink-danessa-myricks-beauty-luxe-cream-palette-in-the-feminist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pink</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Danessa Myricks Beauty Luxe Cream Palette in The Feminist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Danessa Myricks Beauty Luxe Cream Palette in The Feminist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GtNWihqtB2fY1pHAiIZGnyeRHOM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/danessa-myricks-beauty-luxe-cream-palette-in-the-feminist--c95d7352e9034ce8bf29d71d2df8e398.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beautylish</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there are hundreds of red lipsticks to suit a variety of skin tones, it’s not so easy to find a pink that is universally flattering. “It’s all about how soft or bold you want your lip color and knowing which colors play best with your skin tone to achieve that look,” says Bryant, who recommends the cream palettes from Danessa Myricks Beauty to customize your perfect shade of pink. While it’s not exactly purse friendly, it’s great for travel —&nbsp;you’ll be packing 12 lipsticks in one easy palette — and they can be used on cheeks too, cutting down makeup bag bulk even further.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that Danessa Myricks is an artistry brand, meaning pigment payoff is strong, so start with a light application first and layer from there.

The curated collection of shades largely consists of neutrals (think Victoria’s signature lip during her Posh Spice years), though you’ll find a few vibrant shades in there. The formula also sheers out easily, so if the color is too intense for your liking, you can bring it down, and the slim bullet makes for easy targeted application, especially on thinner or aging lips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the bullet being thinner than most, the (truly beautiful!) tube is on the petite side of average, which makes it great for slipping into a tight pocket or a tiny purse, but if you’re looking for value in your lipstick purchase, this may not be your first choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet｜<strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 15｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Rosehip, coconut, and avocado oils</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most important factor in wearing makeup is that you feel good in it, full stop.

Look for something that livens up your whole face when you apply it and avoid colors that make you look washed out or ruddy.

Ultra-matte lipsticks tend to make lips feel parched and can often make them look it, too. Similarly, frosty and glittery lipsticks can reveal more texture than you might like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve always relied on matte lipsticks in the past, you may be reluctant to give them up as they typically have excellent longwearing properties, despite their dryness. While many satin formulas boast impressive wear these days, there are tricks you can use to lock them down. We love Thomas’s simple technique: After applying lip liner and then your lipstick, blot your lips until you see zero color on the tissue. This is a great method for a formula like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Urban Decay Vice Hydrating Lipstick</a>, which feels extremely comfortable on the lips and provides wonderful color payoff, but can transfer some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make any lip last longer, Lujan recommends prepping and priming your skin, both on the lips themselves as well as the surrounding area. “Hydrating and nourishing the skin is super important,” says Lujan. “I would suggest doing it first thing in the morning andagain right before bed.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For added conditioning, try an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>intensive lip treatment</a>.

You’ll want to look for ingredients that not only feel good, but support your lip health. “I love any type of butter, emollient, or waxy base,” says Lujan. “They tend to wear well and help repel water.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lo specifically recommends shea butter, coconut oil, and hyaluronic acid, all ingredients that help nourish and lock water into the skin.

That’s assessing the lip shape and determining how you’d like your lips to look once you’ve put on your lipstick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For example, my lips take a slight downward turn at the corners, so before applying any color, I start with a little concealer applied to the bottom corners of my lips,” she explains. “I’m basically ‘erasing’ a tiny amount of my natural lip line so that it blends with the skin on my face, leaving a lip shape that appears softened and lifted.” From there, she applies her lipstick of choice, then uses a lip liner, being sure to work it into the edge of the lipstick for a seamless blend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When selecting a lip liner, Lujan recommends using a shade similar to your natural lip color. “This makes it easy to balance or overdraw with confidence,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas recommends starting in the center of your top lip, sculpting out your Cupid’s bow before lining the center of your bottom lip and wrapping up this slow and methodical technique by “connecting to the center from the outside corners of the mouth inward.” Finish by dusting a light veil of translucent powder on top for ultimate longevity.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best lipstick formula for an older woman?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What you wear is always up to you, but all of our experts recommend looking for something soft. “A creamy lipstick is best as it keeps the lips hydrated rather than drying them out and deepening fine lines,” says Lo.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You also want the texture to be just right: “I find most matte formulas to be too drying and that glossy textures feather too easily, but satin formulas mimic the texture of a healthy lip,” says Thomas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A satin finish is the Goldilocks of lipsticks:&nbsp;Not too creamy, not too flat, but just right.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a freelance writer, editor, and consultant with over a decade of experience in the beauty industry.
