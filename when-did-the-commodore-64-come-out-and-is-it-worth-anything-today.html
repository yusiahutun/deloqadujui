This final iteration was essentially a C64 without the keyboard, presented as a game console with the rear cartridge port of the original mounted on top.</p><p>It did not sell well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Commodore 65 was also planned, but this was nixed after a few prototypes; some of these still exist.</p><h2 id=who-made-the-commodore-64>Who Made the Commodore 64?</h2><p>Commodore Business Machines manufactured the Commodore 64, a subsidiary of Commodore International.</p><p>Presented to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel as an affordable replacement for the VIC-20 (released in 1980), system developers Bob Russell, Bob Yannes, Al Charpentier, and Charles Winterble were able to complete design of the computer’s chips by November 1981.</p><p>Switching on the Commodore 64 almost instantly brings up the Commodore BASIC 2.0 environment and READY prompt. Commodore BASIC is based on Microsoft BASIC and was licensed from a young Bill Gates in 1977 for just $25,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/muo-tech-explained-otd-c64c-variant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Commodore 64 used the same case and keyboard as the earlier VIC-20 to save costs. Colors may have varied, but this was the famous “bread bin” machine (which incidentally looks nothing like any bread bin you’ve ever seen).</p><p>The Guinness Book of Records lists the Commodore 64 as the biggest selling computer of all time, based on having a single hardware model.</p><h2 id=why-was-the-commodore-64-so-popular>Why Was the Commodore 64 So Popular?</h2><p>Various factors contributed to the Commodore 64’s success. While the initial $700 price tag was expensive, it soon dropped with the computer’s increased popularity. This was due to things like the wide selection of software, some compatibility with the earlier Commodore VIC-20, and the choice of running software from audio cassette, 5.25-inch floppy disk, and cartridge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Commodore 64 had a 16 color palette, could support parallax (all-direction) scrolling, and multiple animated colored sprites thanks to the VIC-II chip. It also featured a programmable audio chip, the MOS Technology 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device or SID. Several years ahead of its time, the audio capabilities of the SID remain sort after more than 40 years later.</p><p>I was fortunate to own a Commodore 64 (and still do) from 1984 onward. At that time, just a year after the famous video game crash that almost destroyed the industry, the C64 was clearly the best and widest-supported option in a marketplace that included computers from Apple, Tandy, and IBM.</p><p>It also had a massive library of games, currently estimated to be around 10,000 (with more released every week even now).</p><h2 id=can-a-commodore-64-connect-to-the-internet>Can a Commodore 64 Connect to the Internet?</h2><p>While the internet is considered to be a modern invention, you’re probably equating it with the Web. In fact, the internet has been accessible to the public since January 1st, 1983.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Consequently, the Commodore 64 and other computers of its generation where all able to access an early internet thanks to modems. In the case of the C64, this meant using a modem cartridge to which a phone line was connected. Some modems shipped with an acoustic coupler—basically a device the phone handset rested on, face down—where phone lines could not be detached.</p><p>In the old days of the internet, basic online games could be played on a Commodore 64 (or other computer), typically RPGs on bulletin boards.</p><p>These days, you can connect a Commodore 64 to the internet over Wi-Fi. This is possible using a custom-built interface card that connects to the user port (the left-most rear port on the C64 when viewed from the front).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With one of these hooked up, you can still access BBS and interact with other C64 users.</p><h2 id=is-a-commodore-64-computer-worth-anything-today>Is a Commodore 64 Computer Worth Anything Today?</h2><p>If you own an old C64 and are thinking of selling it, or you’re considering buying one, you’re probably wondering how much a Commodore 64 is worth.</p><p>The going price of a Commodore 64 on eBay is anything from around $50 to $300, depending on various factors:</p><ul><li>Condition</li><li>Whether the Commodore 64 is in its original box</li><li>Modifications (such as a SD card reader, or replacement keyboard and chips)</li><li>Whether the computer has accessories and games</li></ul><p>As so many were built, it’s not difficult to find an affordable Commodore 64 for sale on eBay. Meanwhile, if you own one in good condition, you could be sitting on a nice little bonus.</p><h2 id=are-commodore-64-games-worth-anything>Are Commodore 64 Games Worth Anything?</h2><p>It’s very easy to download Commodore 64 games and play them in an emulator (see below) but if you already have a collection of old games, you might be interested in selling them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But where can you put Commodore 64 games up for sale, and are these classic C64 games worth anything?</p><p>As with any classic computing and gaming platform, most games are not worth very much. After all, they can be freely (if illegally) downloaded from the web.</p><p>Rare games, however, are expensive, as are those in unopened boxes in mint condition. Cartridge games are rarer than disk; disk games are rarer than cassette. You could be paying anywhere from 99c to $999 for classic Commodore 64 games, depending on the title, media, and condition.</p><h2 id=how-to-run-commodore-64-software-today>How to Run Commodore 64 Software Today</h2><p>If you can’t get hold of a Commodore 64 but want to sample some of its software, you don’t need the original computer.</p><p>Commodore 64 emulation software can be installed on desktop and mobiles. Usually based on software called VICE, Commodore 64 emulators can be difficult to use as they have various setting that need to be tweaked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/muo-tech-explained-emulator.jpg><p>A solution like the mini Commodore 64 from Retro Games Ltd is an affordable alternative. TheC64 Mini (and its life-sized sequel, TheC64) presents a carousel-based user interface that lets you select any of the pre-installed games. You can also add games using a USB stick.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you’re feeling practical and have a Raspberry Pi, you can effectively <a href=#>build your own C64 Mini</a>.</p><h2 id=the-commodore-64-represents-over-40-years-of-home-computing>The Commodore 64 Represents Over 40 Years of Home Computing</h2><p>It is incredible to think that a computer released in 1982 is not only still running, but also sought after. A market exists for the SID chips alone; boxed C64s sell for hundreds of dollars, and there are some rare games that collectors still seek.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With emulation software and emulation systems like TheC64 Mini available, you get the feeling that this particular classic computer is going to be around for at least another 40 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZ2eYrGqsIytn55lk6S6rrvDqKmeZWZpeqS7zJ5kqK2kYq6vsIyiqmahpGLEsL7ToWSapqmptaq6xmarqJyRrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-facts-about-eminem.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Facts About Eminem - Facts.net</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reba-mcentire-without-makeup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reba McEntire Without Makeup</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
