src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19832788.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/angry_birds_land_thorpe_park_4d_cinema_experience_review-382172><p>They've already taken over the app world.</p><p>Now Angry Birds have catapulted their way into Surrey's Thorpe Park – and as well as rides like&nbsp;King Pig’s Wild Hog Dodgems and the white-knuckle Detonator: Bombs Away drop tower, a 4D film provides a thrilling experience for&nbsp;fans of all ages of the feathered flocks and piggy characters.</p><p>The specially-built cinema seems like any other movie theatre but once the film starts, you'll feel like you're one of the characters hurtling through the air and crashing through buildings.</p><p>Younger kids will marvel at the 3D film – but will be blown away as the seats pull back, throw forward and rumble with every action that takes place on the big screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19832787.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/113023><p>I took my four-year-old daughter along for the opening night and after being dazzled at seeing the Angry Birds as if they were right in front of her, she laughed excitedly and held on tight for the full 10-minute experience.</p><p>I've never been one for endless rides so to have something like this at a theme park breaks the day up nicely – it's like a mini day out within a day out.</p><p>As the Angry Birds attempted to get their precious eggs back from King Pig, timed air gusts, water jets, leg ticklers, flashing lights, bubbles and smoke blasts made the whole thing truly immersive.</p><p>Thorpe Park is known for its fast and vertigo-inducing rides like The Swarm and Stealth but Angry Birds Land adds extra appeal for families with young children.</p><p>The flying birds are not the only new addition to the park this year – the Thorpe Shark hotel has just swung open it's giant mouth to welcome guests who don't fancy a drive home after a day on the rides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19813759.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/113024><p>A giant shark sculpture with its mouth wide open greets you on your way to your room, which are contained in a giant industrial-looking container.</p><p>But don't let that put you off – the rooms are small but comfortable and a porthole gives you a glimpse of the scenic waterside view.</p><p>We stayed in one of the waterfront rooms on the resort's island, situated just a few feet away from the resort entrance, and it's very much like sleeping in a ship's cabin.</p><p>A double bed and a bunk bed means a family of four can fit in, while a rain shower wet room adds to the nautical feel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19813756.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/113020><p>Temperature control and air con meant that our wet day out (this is Britain after all) wasn't ended with a miserable journey home.</p><p>The chance to relax and watch TV (including a free copy of Jaws), or play the Angry Birds app after a busy day on the rides was a welcome touch.</p><p>There's also free WIFI and even an on-demand movie sevice that means kids (and adults) won't be bored following their day of thrills.</p><p>However, my daughter was more interested in the changeable mood lighting – it goes to show the simplest things can entertain fresh minds.</p><p>Added perks include breakfast before the park opens and the chance to go on the rides before a single person can walk through the doors in the morning – so it's worth thinking about during those busy summer hols.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
