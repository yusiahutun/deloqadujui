"He came to London to see me, and then he went to Italy," she explained. "He traveled like four countries to come see me. He is the perfect man. He's the man of my dreams."</p><p>Kelly said that after meeting Rick at his own barbecue, the two started talking "every day."</p><p>"He writes me love emails every morning when I wake up. We FaceTime. We have this like old romance," she said, as Emily noted, "Like he was courting you."</p><p>"Yeah, courting me!" Kelly repeated.</p><p>A show producer then asked, "So you guys never kissed or anything when you were [in that phase]?"</p><p>"No, but we were like in love when when we were talking to each other," Dodd explained. "And I said, 'What happens if he has a small dick?' If he had a small dick, there was no way. Like, that ain't gonna happen... No, he's perfect."</p><p>"So when did you finally get together?" asked the producer, refraining from point-blank asking Dodd when she and Leventhal sealed the deal.</p><p>"When he went to London and he came and stayed with me, we hooked up right away. Like, two seconds when he came through that door," she said, winking at Emily. According to Instagram, Dodd and Leventhal were in London together on Aug. 24, meaning their non-sexual romance lasted less than a month. He also proposed after less than three months of dating, but hey, when ya know, ya know!</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"He's awesome," Kelly told her co-star. "I've never been this happy and so in love. Ever. Like, ever. In my whole life."</p><p>Laughing hysterically, Emily blurted out, "Now you get to watch a whole show about Brian!"</p><p>Dodd laughed, too. "Isn't that embarrassing?!" she asked, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"That's alright. It could be worse!" said Simpson. "You could be married to Shane!"</p><p>Speaking of Shane, it's been reported he failed his fourth attempt at passing the California bar exam, so TooFab has contacted the Simpsons seeking comment.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Andy Cohen also revealed</a></strong> on Tuesday's "Watch What Happens Live" that the polarizing Househusband makes an appearance at the ladies' Season 14 reunion, which was filmed last week.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e9/16by9/2019/11/19/e93906ddc36b502fb1aea1163923f816_md.png width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"The Real Housewives of Orange County" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
