The former fast-food worker decided to take&nbsp;Pickler & Ben co-host Ben Aaron back to the scene of her first job to show him the ropes and see if he could make it at the establishment.</p><p>During a recent episode of Pickler & Ben, the country singer put on her old uniform and skates to teach Aaron all about serving customers. At the start of the nearly four-minute clip, Pickler tells Aaron that she wants to share with him what it was like to be a Sonic employee.</p><p>"Ben, I used to love this uniform," Pickler admits while donning her red Sonic T-shirt. "I never had to wake up in the morning too early and decide what I was gonna wear. I already knew."</p><p>Aaron then puts on his name tag and grabs the change belt to clip onto his uniform before Pickler eagerly puts him to work.</p><p><strong>Do You Remember Kellie Pickler's American Idol Audition?</strong></p><p>"Ben needs to know how to work the fountain station," she says as she shows him how to prepare drinks for patrons. Then she demands, "Are you paying attention? You ain't paying no mind."</p><p>Her co-host eventually makes his first shake before Pickler tells him to strap on his skates. Looking terrified, it's obvious that Aaron isn't the most experienced on roller skates. After several failed attempts to hold a tray and skate out to customers, Pickler gives him the restaurant's version of desk duty: the drive-through window.</p><p>"I feel like the drive-through window will be the money maker for you," she tells him.</p><p>"All you gotta do is talk, right?" Aaron asks. Well, yes, but there is some charm to share with customers and as Pickler walks him through it, Aaron finally passes the test. Watch above to see Pickler put her co-host through his paces.</p><p><strong>See Country Stars' Worst Pre-Fame Jobs</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2cobamec%2BimqSklad6sb7EZp2apZVit7CujKymp6GTYrCivseop2arm5bBpr%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-blake-shelton-songs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Best Blake Shelton Songs Offer a Little Something for Everyone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./this-19-billion-japan-airport-slowly-sinking-might-fully-sink-into-the-ocean-by-2056.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This $19 Billion Japan Airport Slowly Sinking Might Fully Sink Into the Ocean By 2056</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
