"That's not the case at all," she reportedly said, saying that the rumors "weren't true."</p><p>In fact, she told the attending fans that she and her granddaughter had gone out to dinner just before Priscilla flew to the UK. "Everything's good," she assured them, adding, "Riley and I get along well."</p><p>Her words echoed those of her son, Navarone Garibaldi Garcia, who shut down feud rumors on his Instagram Live earlier this week. He also referred to a family dinner. "No feud," he said, per <a href=#>The Sun</a>. "We did go to dinner, it went great, it's all good."</p><p>As noted by <a href=#>People</a>, Navarone had previously shared a <a href=#>snap</a> on Monday of himself "dressed up for dinner with my mama last week," teasing in the comments that he "maybe" took pics with Priscilla and Riley while there.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a8b09638-aaf9-454b-9e75-e9fb0b9683be data-container-ref=toofab:article:efe6088f-5545-4785-a43b-848b6e629118 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fb/5by4/2023/01/24/fb75253923a44028b1e63bb3dcce9dc5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Priscilla Presley Thanks Fans For Support During 'Difficult Time' After Lisa Marie's Memorial</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Priscilla's legal filing is currently set for a court hearing on May 16. She argued that she was unaware of the amendment to Lisa Marie's will until after her death, which she claims was a violation of the trust. Since then, there have been multiple reports the two have not been speaking to one another, but that may not be entirely accurate.</p><p>During the UK event, Priscilla expressed how proud she is of Riley's current work on Amazon Prime Video's "Daisy Jones & The Six." ET's insider said that Priscilla said she was "really proud" of what Riley has achieved in her career.</p><p>On Wednesday, Riley was nominated for two MTV Movie & TV Awards for her work as the titular Daisy Jones, including Best Performance in a Show and the always delightfully awkward Best Kiss.</p><a id=gallery-link-528c0c00-56e5-4575-8562-f2fbe0db3706 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:528c0c00-56e5-4575-8562-f2fbe0db3706 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:efe6088f-5545-4785-a43b-848b6e629118 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/4by3/2023/03/23/0de3bc66f1894a82875739ce14cc63da_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21maW5fpb%2Bqv8Kio6WZXaW%2Fpr%2FLnrBmnJWjtqa%2FjKuspqeimrFussSum2aqmaGyunnKnqaun5hk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wework-01-new-york-city-set-elite-working-space-millionaires-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WeWork for the .01%: New York City is set to get elite co-working space for millionaires</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khalid-announces-north-american-arena-dates.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khalid Announces North American Arena Dates</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
