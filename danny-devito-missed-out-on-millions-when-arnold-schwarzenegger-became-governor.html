It was a big risk for the bodybuilder, as he had mostly been known for his action parts before then. The likes of Terminator, Predator, Commando and Total Recall had pinned the <a href=#>movie</a> star as someone who likes to fight, shoot guns and say iconic catchphrases. But the <a href=#>celebrity</a> wanted to branch out. So much so, that he didn’t take a salary at all for Twins, which went on to become a hit. However, his choices later on in life affected Danny DeVito taking a paycheck too.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-danny-devito-wanted-arnold-schwarzenegger-to-do-a-sequel>Danny DeVito wanted Arnold Schwarzenegger to do a sequel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-464713722-1024x820.jpg><p>The 78-year-old told GQ he and Arnie are raring to work together again. He also explained how he missed an opportunity to do Twins 2 because the Terminator star had his eyes on another prize – becoming California’s Governor.</p><p>Because of his focus in politics, it meant the new Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzenegger mash up never happened. It also meant neither of them got the paycheck they rightfully deserved for doing so as well.</p><p>He joked: “We missed&nbsp;Twins 2, because he became governor — which, he should have done&nbsp;Twins 2&nbsp;instead of becoming governor.”</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger paired up with Danny DeVito in the 1998 movie. It follows two genetically engineers fraternal twins who were separated at birth. The next installment has actually been in the works for years, but it hasn’t come to anything. It’s hard to imagine if <a href=#>Hollywood</a> will sit patiently any longer for the time to be right.</p><p>The sequel, Triplets, was set to add Eddie Murphy in the mix, or Tracy Morgan. However, it was put on hold following Ivan Reitman’s death – the director behind the first flick.</p><p>But DeVito and Arnie did work together again after Twins, for Reitman’s comedy Junior. It also featured Nanny McPhee’s Emma Thompson. It followed the real-life Hulk as he underwent a male pregnancy. Danny then had a voice role in Arnie’s 1993 movie, The Last Action Hero, where the Matilda star voiced a cartoon cat detective.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollywood-tease>Hollywood tease</h2><p>Both stars have teased that there is something in the works. Danny also said he and Arnie “have a little thing going, a little project that we’ve been chatting about”.</p><p>When asked if it’s Twins 2 or another written sequel, he denied it.</p><p>He then joked: “Because we have a good time together. We complement each other in a lot fo ways. I am way stronger than he is.”</p><p>And back in May, Arnie did the same to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>He said: “I’m developing another movie with Danny. He’s so much fun to work with and so talented.”</p><p>Despite Danny DeVito saying Twins 2 is still on the cards, Arnold Schwarzenegger seemed to think the opposite. He previously claimed the sequel Triplets fell through because Reitman’s son, Jason, wasn’t convinced. He’s also a director, but didn’t take the bait.</p><p>Twins made more than $215 million in its release at the Box Office. Although Arnie didn’t take money home, Danny did. So the sequel would have earned many more millions too most likely.</p><p>Will we see the duo together on screen again? We hope so.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WDcLDAp6WyZZSaw6rAzmakoqujmrFuu9StZKimXaK2rbjIqKWsZaedsq95wKulqKSUYsCktNaaqbOdnpq0qLHRZpmem5Gism6zzq%2Bcq6afp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./better-skin-in-14-days-i-put-estee-lauders-newest-skincare-innovation-to-the-test.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Put Este Lauder's Newest Skincare Innovation to the Test</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dougies-twin-peaks-statue-the-meaning-behind-it-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Hidden Significance Behind Dougies Favorite Statue in Twin Peaks: The Return</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
