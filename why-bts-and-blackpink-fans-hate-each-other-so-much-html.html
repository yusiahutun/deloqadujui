Here's our look into the stars of K-pop music.</p><p>Published on July 3, 2020</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_51>According to their fans, both of these K-pop groups are the best. While there’s no denying their influence, <a href=#>BLACKPINK and BTS</a> made their mark in different ways. Here’s our look at these bands and why their fans, (the <a href=#>BTS ARMY and BLINKS</a>,) seem to always be in competition with one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BTS-BLACKPINK.jpg><h2>It seems like BTS and BLACKPINK are always in competition, and their fan bases are no different</h2><p id=par-2_43>These pop idols are dominating the music charts, but they’re not doing it alone. Thanks to the support of BTS’ fan base, nicknamed the BTS ARMY and the BLACKPINK fan base, nicknamed BLINKS, these musicians became some of the world’s top social artists.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_50>BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the Grammy Awards. BLACKPINK became one of the first K-pop groups to perform at the California music festival, Coachella. With both groups succeeding, fans often take it upon themselves to stream their music and earn their music videos plenty of views.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Both BTS and BLACKPINK collaborated with award-winning American artists, gaining recognition and fans overseas</h2><p id=par-4_51>Throughout their career, BTS branched out to work with a number of international icons. Their album Map of the Soul: 7 featured Sia, whereas Map of the Soul: Persona featured Halsey on their song “Boy With Luv.” It’s that song that the boy band performed live at the Billboard Music Awards.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_44>Recently, BLACKPINK appeared on Lady Gaga’s album, Chromatica, where they performed the song “Sour Candy.” Aside from collaborating with other artists, though, both K-pop groups release music on their own, prompting a battle of their fan bases regarding which release would earn more views.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>This June, BTS released ‘Stay Gold,’ while BLACKPINK released ‘How You Like That’</h2><p id=par-6_33>A pandemic won’t stop these K-pop groups from dominating YouTube and the pop music charts. BTS released “Stay Gold” while BLACKPINK released the first song of their comeback, titled “How You Like That.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_49>In terms of which song garnered more views, “How You Like That” comes on top. In terms of which is the “fan-favorite” song, a poll from <a href=#>Billboard</a> gives that recognition to “Stay Gold,” which earned 84% of the votes. Fans of both artists shared their well-wishes on social media.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_37>“Blinks be like Armyblinks don’t actually stan BLACKPINK and Armys be like Armyblinks don’t actually stan BTS and Armyblinks be like wouldn’t it be cool if our favs followed each other on Twitter,” one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user noted.</p><p id=par-9_55>At the end of the day, though, K-pop stans often come together for the greater good. That includes helping out during the Black Lives Matter movement, filling hashtags on social media with “fan cams” of their favorite artists. Music by both BLACKPINK and BTS is available for streaming on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqcWMm6usZZGjsW6uy5qapKiZo7hussCnqmagkamybrHAnJ9mp6SdsrN50qhkpq2TnXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-plays-joker-every-actor-whos-portrayed-the-batman-villain.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Plays Joker?
