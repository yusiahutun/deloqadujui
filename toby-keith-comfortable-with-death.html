"I got to the point where I was comfortable with whatever happened. I had my brain wrapped around it, and I was in a good spot either way.</p><p>"... Cancer is a roller coaster," he reflected during the interview. "It's like, you just sit here and wait on it to go away — it may not ever go away. Even if it goes in remission, it'll still be in the back of your mind. You're still gonna have to do scans and stuff."</p><p>In that interview, Keith said he owed that sense of calm to his relationship with his faith. "People without faith don't have that," he remarked, adding that cancer was a powerful reminder to never take his faith for granted.</p><p>"You take it for granted on the days that things are good, and you lean on it when days are bad. It has taught me to lean on [it] a little more every day," Keith said.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>13 Stunning Truths About Toby Keith's Life, Family + Music</a></strong></p><h3>How Did Toby Keith Die?</h3><p>Keith <a href=#>died</a> on Feb. 5 at the age of 62, according to a statement shared to his website and social media pages.</p><p>He had been <a href=#>battling stomach cancer</a> for over two years, a diagnosis he announced to fans in summer 2022.
