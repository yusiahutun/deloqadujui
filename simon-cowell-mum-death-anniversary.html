Two years ago today she passed and we still love her dearly. So many memories. Sleep well mum x."</p><p id=eFBl8c1L2HCE data-wc=79>At the time, Simon and his family were left heartbroken after <a class=hm-link href=#>Julie died</a> of a stroke. She had reportedly spent time in a London hospital enduring a lengthy health battle, which Simon had chosen to keep private. In a statement, the Cowell family said: "Today our beloved mum Julie passed away. Anyone who had met her would know what a truly special and kind lady she was. We are heartbroken and will miss her terribly, but she is now at peace."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p style=text-align:center id=eIPT4e3MBJQR data-wc=9><strong>Simon Cowell's brother Tony paid tribute to their mum</strong></p><p id=eKZqbo5Io9b5 data-wc=77>Two days after his mother's death, <a class=hm-link href=#>Simon was back at work</a> for auditions. He explained his swift return on <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Loose Women</a></strong>, saying: "She was a huge fan of the show, she loved the show which sort of made the decision, 'When do you go back to work on something like this?' because it's hard and it really was what I thought she would have said to me which was, 'No 100 per cent you've got to go back to work.'"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=exblVggDb82R data-wc=102>Julie was a mother to four boys – Nicholas, Simon, Tony and Michael – and step-mother to John and June Cowell. She was incredibly close to the head judge, and loved seeing him settle down with American partner Lauren Silverman and have a son, Eric, now three. Julie was always an incredible source of strength for Simon, particularly after the TV star lost his dad, Eric, in 1999. Eric died at home from a heart attack and opening up to <a class=hm-link href=#>Piers Morgan</a>, Simon recalled: "I can't lie, it was the worst day of my life. It was a horrible, horrible time."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
