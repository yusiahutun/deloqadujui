He played his first credit role in <i>A Time For Killing</i> (1967). He rose to prominence for his role in the <i>Star Wars </i>trilogy and <i>Indiana Jones</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Harrison Ford was born on July 13th, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, United States.

He has been featured in several <a href=#>television series and movies</a>. He has also won incredible awards, including the <i>People's Choice Awards</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/153da1aa920944b1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Was Howard Rollins Jr ever married and did he have kids?</span></p></a><h2>Is Harrison Ford gay?</h2><p class=align-left>Harrison has played some roles as gay and has an earring. These, among other reasons, may have led many fans to question his sexuality. However, the sexual orientation of film characters isnâ€™t always what it first seems.</p><p class=align-left>Some leading <a href=#>actors</a> and actresses have reinterpreted their parts as they move off the screens. Harrison Ford, for instance, has been married three times in his lifetime. Additionally, he has been married only to women and therefore, there is no reason to doubt his sexuality.</p><h2>Harrison Ford's wife and marriages</h2><p class=align-left>The American actor is married to Calista Flockhart, an actress. The couple has been married since 2010. They first met at the Golden Globe Awards on January 20th, 2002. They began dating and got engaged on <a href=#>Valentine's day</a> in 2009 and tied the knot on June 15th, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p><p class=align-left>Is Harrison Ford still married to Clarissa Lockhart? Yes, they are still a couple. They have been married for more than 10 years and have adopted a son called Liam. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ford was married twice</a> before.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1962ae70b9245b24.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 hottest older white male actors who are over 50 years old</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He first tied the knot with his college girlfriend, Mary Marquardt. They were together from 1964 to 1979. They had two sons together, Benjamin and Willard. In 1983, he married screenwriter, Melissa Mathison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c2032f88a7a4c385.jpg><p class=align-left>Melissa Mathison and Ford met during the making of 1979's <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. They dated for a few years and got married in 1983. They share two sons, Malcolm and Georgia. Sadly, they parted ways in 2004.</p><p class=align-left>Harrison then married Clarissa six years later. But, do Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart have a child together? Unfortunately, these two have not had a child together.</p><h2>Does Harrison support LGBTQ?</h2><p class=align-left>Harrison isn't gay but has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">vocal about his support</a> for the LGBTQ. In 2013, activists called for a boycott of Harrison's film <i>Ender's Game</i> after its author, Orson Scott Card, opposed gay marriages. In addition, Scott openly showed his opposition to same-sex marriage when he joined the board of the National Organization for Marriage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bb1d4bea0624d551.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 famous celebrities who live in Colorado in 2024 (and best hotspots)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But Harrison spoke out about the controversy surrounding the film at the Comic-Con event in 2013. He said that Orson Scott's <a href=#>comments</a> were completely separate from the film.</p>None of Mr Card's concerns, regarding the issue of gay marriage are part of the thematics of this film... I think his views outside of those that we deal with in this film are not an issue for me to deal with.<h2>Why does Harrison wear an earring?</h2><p class=align-left>The American actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got the ear accessory</a> back in 1997 when he was 55, and the reason is surprising and funny. Harrison had been lunching with buddies Jimmy Buffett and the late <i>60 Minutes </i>correspondent Ed Bradley. Interestingly, they all had the same phones and watches, except that he did not have an earring like them.</p><p class=align-left>So immediately after lunch, he and his ex-wife Melissa Mathison went into the Lexington Avenue boutique. Ford had his ear pierced by the employee on duty called Tavora Escossery. Afterwards, he signed a notepad: "To Tavora. You made a hole in me. Harrison Ford".</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0deada9aa5f24422.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kia commercial actors and actresses profiles and TV roles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you have been asking the question, "is Harrison Ford gay?" The American actor is definitely not gay. He has been married to women and is a father of five sons. However, he believes in equal rights for everyone and thus supports the LGBTQs.</p><p class=align-left>What do you know about <a href=#>Gabriel Iglesias' wife</a>? In its publications, <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> has an engaging piece on the American actor and comedian. He is undoubtedly one of the most successful persons in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=align-left>Most fans have shown interest in the comedian's dating life. Interestingly, Gabriel Iglesias is quite open.
