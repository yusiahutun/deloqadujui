Shortly after <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a> and <a href=#>Mike Fisher</a> had their marriage turned upside down by an <a href=#>impending divorce</a>, friends of the couple have revealed that they’re doing better than ever — and have even sparked pregnancy rumors! “Friends think Carrie is pregnant, and the buzz is that she’s expecting twins!” an insider recently told <a href=#>Life & Style</a>.</p><p>“If you know Carrie at all, [you know] she’s been wanting at least two more kids since she had <a href=#>son Isaiah</a> in 2015. Twins would be music to her ears!” While the former <a href=#>American Idol</a> champ has yet to confirm that she has two buns in the oven, friends have pointed to the fact that she is eating more than she did during her first pregnancy as possible evidence she’s carrying two this time around.</p><p>“She’s eating far more than she ever did last time she was pregnant and craving foods like dark chocolate and Subway veggie sandwiches,” the insider said. “Carrie’s also begun scaling back on sessions with her personal trainer.” And the 35-year-old hasn’t exactly been subtle when discussing it with her friends.</p><p>The insider said she’s been commenting on baby clothes and “both she and Mike have said that their next big home renovation project is a room for a nursery. Carrie loves fairy tales and <a href=#>children’s books</a>, and would custom design the room as a little kingdom for the twins and stock it with classic books.”</p><p>Of course, recent months have been full of ups and downs for the couple; late last year, Carrie had <a href=#>an accident</a> that left her with <a href=#>40 to 50 stitches</a> on her face. Additionally, she and Mike were facing a divorce earlier this year, when their busy schedules took a toll on their marriage.</p><p>But despite their <a href=#>maritals woes</a> — this definitely isn’t a “fix it” pregnancy. A source said, “It’s definitely not to fix anything, but to spread the love. Isaiah is the love of their lives, but they have room in their hearts for more children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZerG%2BxKClmqakYsG4tc2sZGptZ2V%2FeHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./einsteins-sister-to-headline-ribco-last-call.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Einsteins Sister to headline RIBCO last call</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./66300cfa22601d06348b45e9-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bara: El hat-trick de Lewandowski calienta la pelea por el pichichi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
