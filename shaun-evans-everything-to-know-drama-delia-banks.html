Find out everything to know here…</p><p id=esL-RrCOCvA data-wc=58>In the new ITV four-part show, Shaun is set to star opposite Anna Maxwell Martin. The story is based on Delia's memoir, Living with a Serial Killer, in which Delia shared her brave story about her relationship with Sweeney. The nurse was dating Sweeney back in 1991, when he confessed to her that he had murdered his ex-girlfriend.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Endeavour star Shaun Evans looks unrecognisable in his first TV role!</figure><p id=exJutEQ_NRm data-wc=35>Discussing Delia's story, Shaun said: "A story that is quite rightly told through the victim's lens, Delia. We have an excellent script from Nick Stevens and I couldn't be more delighted to work with Anna."</p><p id=ezW_zv1aUW0 data-wc=46>The synopsis of her book reads: "At first he was caring but over the course of their relationship he became violent and controlling. On more than one occasion he held Delia hostage and tortured her. Chillingly, he also confessed to the murder of his previous girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b51b9537b573-shaun-evans-as-endeavour-morse-d.jpg><p id=egqTggWLbiT data-wc=58>"After one serious assault, Sweeney was released on bail, and left her in the utmost fear knowing that he would return to finish her off. After a final frenzied attack leaving Delia on the brink of death, Sweeney went on the run. Astonishingly, it would take the police six years to capture and convict Sweeney of multiple murders."</p><p id=eY99WcBwxvT data-wc=63>Sweeney attacked Delia with an axe in 1994, but she managed to survive the brutal attack. By the time the police had arrived, Sweeney had fled the scene before eventually being arrested for two murders and one attempted murder. The 66-year-old is currently serving a life sentence for the murders of Melissa Halstead and Paula Fields, and for the attempted murder of Delia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a311eeabd898-shaun-evans-home-t.jpg><p id=eukmUr1RoZ3 data-wc=69>Speaking about Delia's story, executive producer for World Productions Simon Heath said: "Delia’s story is a unique and powerful one of a woman who survived terrible violence at the hands of a man who should never have been free to commit his heinous crimes. Delia’s story shines a light on the failings of the legal system to deal with male violence against women and so sadly still resonates today."</p><p id=eYwGSJ5EuwB data-wc=32>The show's screenwriter, Nick Stevens, added: "[She is] a survivor whose determination to pursue the good in life – to dance, to travel, to live – is ultimately greater than her demons."</p><p id=e7iMQIGPz8 data-wc=14><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>5 shows and films to watch if you love Endeavour star Shaun Evans</a></strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=ejWTDjnmYYV data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Shaun Evans reveals why Endeavour had to end with series nine</a></strong></p><p id=eZmidXjVIbe data-wc=62>The project will be a huge change for Shaun, who portrayed Endeavour Morse for nine seasons in the popular show, Endeavour.
