"Johnny worked really hard to trick me into thinking I was flying into the Exumas for a modeling job. I had to take a sea plane to the final destination, and when we were getting ready to land I looked out of the window and I saw the words 'Marry Me' written in roses on the beach—and then I noticed it was Johnny standing there waiting for me," Windsor recalls. The bride adds, "That was definitely one of the happiest and most incredible days of my life that I will never forget."</p><img alt="Vacation, Summer, Poster, Airplane, Fun, Vehicle, Leisure, Tourism, Aircraft, Photography, " title="Vacation, Summer, Poster, Airplane, Fun, Vehicle, Leisure, Tourism, Aircraft, Photography, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-proposal-1574196778.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">El Marco Rojo</span></p><img alt="Wallet, Fashion accessory, Leather, Zipper, Coin purse, " title="Wallet, Fashion accessory, Leather, Zipper, Coin purse, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-58-1574271642.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That was, until she and Johnny began planning an epic three-day wedding in Saint Barthélemy—but more on that later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Devon and Johnny met out and about in New York City, introduced by a mutual friend. "We didn’t think much of it as we were both in a relationships at the time," Devon tells BAZAAR Bride. "We actually didn’t see each other for two years [after that], until we re-met in Miami when I was there for a photo shoot."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was Devon who made the first move. "I got for Johnny's number from his co-worker and texted him to come out for a dinner. He responded the next morning because he was ['supposedly'] working all night—which turned out to be true! He then romanced me during Paris Fashion Week by sending me flowers every morning leading up to a surprise, which ended up being him in town for my birthday—the rest is history."</p><img alt="Photograph, Wedding dress, Dress, Honeymoon, Vacation, Bride, Beach, Wedding, Bridal clothing, Shore, " title="Photograph, Wedding dress, Dress, Honeymoon, Vacation, Bride, Beach, Wedding, Bridal clothing, Shore, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-24-1574271285.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="People on beach, Fun, Vacation, Beach, Muscle, Summer, Sea, Human, Photography, Barechested, " title="People on beach, Fun, Vacation, Beach, Muscle, Summer, Sea, Human, Photography, Barechested, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-26-1574271353.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple began their relationship living in two different cities, with Devon based in New York and traveling constantly for work, and Johnny based in Miami. "Now I basically live in Miami and commute to and from New York for work," she says. Of Johnny's surprise proposal, Devon could not have imagined a moment more indicative of who they are as a couple, and Johnny's penchant for romantic gestures. "I’m a beach lover so it was only fitting that he did something on the beach," she explains. "Johnny is quite the romantic and he never does anything halfway. The proposal was a true representation of who he is: flowers, my favorite food for a picnic, a ring, and a sandbar in the middle of the ocean—every little detail was planned down to perfection."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Johnny proposed with a bespoke piece by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ringconcierge.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ring Concierge" data-vars-ga-product-id=3778d330-c921-4908-bb5e-637ae9a400cc data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://ringconcierge.com/ data-product-url=https://ringconcierge.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fringconcierge.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=fd009145-7565-41dc-80b4-0b53af85e517 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Ring Concierge</a>. "Johnny actually drew out the setting of the ring! He likes to design everything in our lives.

The couple planned on a long engagement, to just "enjoy being an engaged couple." Devon always knew an island wedding was in the cards. "We tossed around a couple ideas but St. Barths seemed like the best place to do it because it’s incredibly beautiful, the service is amazing, the beaches are stunning, his parents and aunts and uncles have all renewed their vows in the same church [there], and the food is delicious."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Johnny and his mother, Annie Barbara, knew that they would be spearheading the event's look, feel, and design, but were on the hunt for an event planner who could execute their vision and style, along with the logistics of a weekend's worth of events seamlessly.

"It's incredibly gorgeous and unique," Devon says. "Its tropical island garden is completed with so many trees, little ponds, and aromatic plants that make you feel like you’re in a jungle. You don’t need to transform this venue, but we felt that we wanted to change everyone's experience and make it unique to us. Johnny and his mother designed the most beautiful lounge settings sprinkled throughout the garden to create a super intimate vibe. Low seating made sure you didn't get too comfortable and joined in on the rhythmic music being provided by the troubadours. Themed hand fans were passed around to keep guests cool while the party continued on the dance floor until late into the night."</p><p>The dress code was all-white—for everyone except the bride. "I wore a custom floral, colorful, embellished <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.shopalexis.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Alexis class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Alexis</a> gown—so I felt like a very special flower that evening," she says. "It was embroidered with colorful flowers and was slightly sheer with a built-in bustier; the colors were just right to accent the party and he flower patterns of the embellishment were worked on for weeks in order to achieve the perfect motifs. I wore it with nude Aquazurra shoes that had little feathers on them."</p><img alt="Trousers, White, Dress, Bridal clothing, Wedding dress, Bride, Temple, Ceremony, Marriage, Tradition, " title="Trousers, White, Dress, Bridal clothing, Wedding dress, Bride, Temple, Ceremony, Marriage, Tradition, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-23-1574271778.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Beach, Body of water, Coast, Sea, Tourism, Shore, Sky, Vacation, Ocean, Coastal and oceanic landforms, " title="Beach, Body of water, Coast, Sea, Tourism, Shore, Sky, Vacation, Ocean, Coastal and oceanic landforms, " width=3851 height=2567 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-27-1574271747.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Fun, Team, Vacation, Spring break, Beach, Leisure, Tourism, " title="Fun, Team, Vacation, Spring break, Beach, Leisure, Tourism, " width=3368 height=2246 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-25-1574271810.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Wedding dress, Dress, Gown, Clothing, Veil, Bridal clothing, Bride, Bridal accessory, Shoulder, Beauty, " title="Wedding dress, Dress, Gown, Clothing, Veil, Bridal clothing, Bride, Bridal accessory, Shoulder, Beauty, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-05-1574271843.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sergio Sandona</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A guest list of top models—like Georgia Fowler, Shanina Shaik, Hannah Ferguson, Noel Berry, Nadine Leopold, Gabby Westbrook, Megan Williams, and Roosmarijn de Kok—joined It-girls Olivia Culpo, Cara Santana, Tori Praver, Shea Marie, Bettina Looney, and more on the shores of St. Barths to celebrate the couple.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And the party continued the next day on the beach at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://shellonabeach.com/en/saint-barts/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Shellona class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Shellona</a>. "[Shellona is] normally more of a traditional restaurant setting, and so we wanted to transform it in to a beach club! Johnny and his mother designed day beds, a 16’ diameter oak bar, striped fringed umbrellas, and hand tie dyed throw pillows to make an exquisite, chic, and cozy sunset beach club environment. We even made a floating raft so people could swim out and enjoy the ocean and sun," Devon said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the beach, Devon created two looks under her new label, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.devonwindsor.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Devon Windsor Swim" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Devon Windsor Swim</a>. "Being a new swimwear designer, I worked closely with my mother-in-law, now-husband, and sister-in-law to design the most intricate hand-embellished pearl and sequin swimsuit that took multiple days of just bead application alone at their atelier. The coverup for my first look also had French macrame lace and French embellished lace trim all framed with pearls to tie in my swimsuit. The second look was a embroidered lace look with high waisted bottoms that had a detachable skirt flowing down the back and a halter top. Both looks were all white and made me feel so so special." The bride capped off the looks with a pair of Jimmy Choo pearl sandals, before kicking them off to put her feet in the sand.<br></p><img alt="Clothing, White, Undergarment, Lingerie, Waist, Bikini, Swimwear, Shoulder, Shorts, Model, " title="Clothing, White, Undergarment, Lingerie, Waist, Bikini, Swimwear, Shoulder, Shorts, Model, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding3-1574271868.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span>Devon’s first of two custom swimwear looks from her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.devonwindsor.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="namesake line" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">namesake line</a>.<img alt="White, Skin, Beauty, Lingerie, Barechested, Model, Fashion, Undergarment, Chest, Summer, " title="White, Skin, Beauty, Lingerie, Barechested, Model, Fashion, Undergarment, Chest, Summer, " width=3268 height=2179 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-09-1574271945.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Clothing, Shoulder, Dress, Fashion model, Wedding dress, Neck, Gown, Model, Blond, Joint, " title="Clothing, Shoulder, Dress, Fashion model, Wedding dress, Neck, Gown, Model, Blond, Joint, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding2-1574271984.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And when it came to having a good time, the couple didn't disappoint. "This was a true beach party with beer pong, cocktails, and the ocean only a few feet away. We kept the florals very simple with greens and miniature lemon trees. All of the furniture at this event was custom-made from Alexis fabrics, even the bar itself was designed by Johnny and his mom." The couple also brought in the body painter from Scorpios Mykonos to hand-paint tribal silver body art on their guests, and had each other's names painted on their chests, along with their wedding date.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The next day, Devon and Johnny exchanged vows at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stbartholomewsanglicanchurch.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="St Bartholomew's Anglican Church" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">St Bartholomew's Anglican Church</a>, one of the oldest structures on the island dating back to the 1850's, and where multiple couples in Johnny's family had renewed their vows in the past.

"I have always been obsessed with his Couture and bridal gowns. His attention to detail is unlike anyone I have ever seen.

On her florists, Devon was simply so grateful to have found them, albeit last minute. "What a life saver! We found Bows and Arrows 12 days before the wedding. [They were] amazing every step of the way. The florals were a marriage of some of my favorite romantic and classic blooms such as peonies, garden roses, and ranunculus with wild architectural and structural flowers [Johnny] gravitates to, like delphinium, astrantia, nerines and hellebores. The compositions were natural, asymmetrical and artistic with movement. We imported flowers from all over the world and paired them with local foliage and native flora and textures from the island," says Devon. While the ceremony was predominantly white and green in palette, the couple settled on shades of peach, mauve, sand, cappuccino, and cream for their reception.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As guests arrived, they were handed eyelet umbrellas and embellished hand fans to shade them from the sun. "The ceremony was intimate and cozy; Hailey Reinhart sang "Can’t Help Falling in Love" as my maid of honor and flower girls walked down the aisle," recalls Devon. "She then paused, the doors closed, and just as we rehearsed, she delivered the rest of the song as the door opened and I saw Johnny for the first time that day at the end of the aisle. His eyes were teary and so were mine. I will never forget that moment."</p><img alt="Vehicle, Cliff, Coast, Transport, Terrain, Highland, Mode of transport, Sea, Car, Mountain, " title="Vehicle, Cliff, Coast, Transport, Terrain, Highland, Mode of transport, Sea, Car, Mountain, " width=3925 height=2617 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-42-1574272681.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=3460 height=2306 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-13-1574272131.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sergio Sandona</span></p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=3328 height=2219 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-14-1574272160.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sergio Sandona</span></p><img alt="Wedding dress, Gown, Photograph, Dress, Bride, Clothing, Bridal clothing, Shoulder, Bridal party dress, Photography, " title="Wedding dress, Gown, Photograph, Dress, Bride, Clothing, Bridal clothing, Shoulder, Bridal party dress, Photography, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-portraits-1574275932.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Wedding dress, Bride, Dress, Gown, White, Clothing, Bridal clothing, Bridal accessory, Beauty, " title="Photograph, Wedding dress, Bride, Dress, Gown, White, Clothing, Bridal clothing, Bridal accessory, Beauty, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-33-1574272189.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Clothing, Sleeve, Trousers, Bridal clothing, Dress, Photograph, Outerwear, Wedding dress, Coat, Happy, " title="Clothing, Sleeve, Trousers, Bridal clothing, Dress, Photograph, Outerwear, Wedding dress, Coat, Happy, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-39-1574272247.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Vehicle, Car, Natural environment, Landscape, Off-road vehicle, Mini SUV, Off-roading, Wadi, Sport utility vehicle, " title="Photograph, Vehicle, Car, Natural environment, Landscape, Off-road vehicle, Mini SUV, Off-roading, Wadi, Sport utility vehicle, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-devon-windsor-wedding-44-1574272268.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melissa Marshall</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In choosing a photographer, the bride couldn't pick just one to work with, hiring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sergiosandona.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sergio Sandoná" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sergio Sandoná</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.melissamarshall.co/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melissa Marshall" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Melissa Marshall</a> to capture the day, along with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aaronnovakfilms.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aaron Novak " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Aaron Novak </a>for videography.
