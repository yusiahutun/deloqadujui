Every year on February 20th, she celebrated her birthday. According to Famous Birthdays, based on her birthday, she was born under the sign of Pisces.</p><h2><span id=CelinaSpookyBoo8217s_parents_siblings_and_real_name>CelinaSpookyBoo’s parents, siblings, and real name</span></h2><p>True Name Celina Horvath Meyers, aka CelinaSpookyBoo, is said to be the daughter of Hungarian parents, as her father’s name is Zoltan. While her father and mother were featured on several occasions, she never revealed any additional information about her parents.</p><p>Furthermore, Celina’s father appears to be a gentle and endearing old man who values his family above all else. When we take a good look at her, we can see that she gets all of her charm and cheerfulness from her mother.</p><p>Celina’s mother also has a chronic illness about which she has never spoken. Her mother, as seen on Instagram, moves around with the assistance of a wheelchair. Her mother will be 60 years old in January 2020, when she will celebrate her birthday.</p><p>One of her hobbies, according to her sibling’s Instagram post, is collecting mixing bowls. When it comes to CelinaSpookyBoo’s siblings, she has one named Joel Horvath. He enjoys bikes and cars and is in a relationship with one, Karissa Neeves.</p><p>The Horvaths were from Woodstock, Ontario, Canada.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p>When it comes to CelinaSpookyBoo’s physical characteristics, she stands tall at 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 meters). In addition, at the time of writing, she weighed about 77 kilograms (169 pounds). Celina is also blessed with long brown wavy hair and a fair complexion. Her chubby appearance and amusing sense of humor make her even cuter.</p><p>Celina went on Instagram in December 2020 and shared a few words about the positive changes she is bringing into her life. She talked about her body weight and buying clothes online in the hopes that they would fit her both literally and metaphorically. Celina, on the other hand, isn’t as concerned about losing weight as most people are. Instead, she has learned to appreciate everything she has been given and to make a few minor changes that suit her.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW142727251 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW142727251 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW142727251 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Celina is best known for her TikTok videos, but she also has a strong following on Instagram and YouTube. As of February 2021, her self-titled YouTube channel had 195k subscribers. Similarly, the Canadian Instagram native’s account has 609k followers which have yet to be verified. She was also on Twitter, where she had 3517 followers, the fewest of any of the others.</p><p>However, it is on TikTok that she has found her career thrive and has an impressive number of followers. Her TikTok videos received 277.8 million likes from her 10.3 million followers. Celina reached 1 million followers on December 19th, which she announced on Instagram the same day.</p><h2><span id=CelinaSpookyBoo_Career_Merch_and_Employment>CelinaSpookyBoo Career, Merch, and Employment</span></h2><p>CelinaSpookyBoo began her career as a social media entertainer in 2014 when she launched The Haunted Estate, a podcast about horror and thrill stories. However, she ceased hosting the podcast in 2018. She discovered a way to pursue a successful career, however, when she fell in love with the short video creation and sharing app TikTok. She began by posting amusing videos every day.</p><p>CelinaSpookyBoo watched her followers grow one day at a time, with the sole goal of making people smile and feel happy after watching her comedy videos. Within four months of using TikTok, she had a million followers.</p><p>CelinaSpookyBoo described herself as a generic ‘weird kid’ in high school. She attended three different high schools and still couldn’t find the environment in which she thrived. Her public profile, on the other hand, has helped her attract other ‘weird people,’ whom she refers to as her fans.</p><p>Celina spends her time writing fiction when she isn’t giving people stomach cramps. She primarily writes horror and thrillers, but she also enjoys writing about paranormals. When she began making podcasts, she began her journey as a writer.</p><p>Celina also ventured into entrepreneurship when she launched her makeup line, BeautyXBoo. She debuted the shadow CelinaSpookyBoo palette, which sold out within minutes of its release. While she created the colors, names, and designs, one of her fans assisted in the creation of cartoons of her likeness. Even after all of her success, she remains humble and true to herself, as well as grateful to her fans.</p><p>Celina was also involved in charitable work. Her fans helped her raise $5000 on Christmas Eve, all of which went to a good cause. Celina also made headlines in 2019 for riding in a hearse. She stuffed her large back trunk with supplies for the homeless, including bags, coats, and backpacks.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_CelinaSpookyBoo><span class="TextRun SCXW166447654 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166447654 BCX8">What is the Net worth of CelinaSpookyBoo?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW166447654 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>CelinaSpookyBoo has been well compensated for her generous heart, as she has a total net worth of $700 thousand.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>CelinaSpookyBoo&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
