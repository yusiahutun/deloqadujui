In a sense, he always has been — whether in the form of the late Cesar Romero on the Adam West Batman&nbsp;TV series of the 1960s, <strong><a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a></strong> in <strong><a href=#>Tim Burton’s</a></strong> 1989 film, <a href=#><strong>Mark Hamill</strong></a> voicing the character in various animated TV shows and films, the late <strong><a href=#>Heath Ledger</a></strong> in The Dark Knight, <strong>Jared Leto</strong> in Suicide Squad&nbsp;or, now, Joaquin. For the most part where Batman has treaded, the Joker hasn’t been far behind.</p><p>“I go back to the <a href=#><strong>Stan Lee</strong></a> theory of supervillains, which is that the longest-lasting and most successful superheroes have been those who have had the greatest supervillains,” offers <strong>Michael Uslan</strong>, comic historian and producer of every Batman movie since the 1989 film starring <strong>Michael Keaton</strong> in the title role of Gotham’s caped crusader. “Arguably, Batman has the greatest supervillain in history in the form of the Joker. He is inspired by the old silent film from German cinema, The Man Who Laughs. It is that carnival mask of a clown that hides the horror lurking below the surface. To have him pitted against the good guy who is in the mask of the horrific, nightmarish bat is an interesting reversal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/joaquin-phoenix-2.jpg><p>The creation of the Joker is generally credited to Batman’s co-creators <strong>Bob Kane</strong> and <strong>Bill Finger</strong> along with <strong>Jerry Robinson</strong>, the character having launched about a year after the hero was introduced in the pages of&nbsp;Detective Comics&nbsp;in 1939. He’s been through all of the ebbs and flows of Batman’s popularity over the past 80 years.</p><p>Writer <strong>Paul Dini</strong>, who has written extensively for comics and television, and was one of the guiding forces behind&nbsp;Batman: The Animated Series, notes that the Joker “has the malleability that Batman does. You can put him in any situation, whether it’s a lighthearted story or a very dark, pitch-black type of story and his sense of humor and cutting cleverness will shine through. It’s only when you mock the character, as it is with Batman, that you lose a sense of who the character is. My own theory is that the Joker likes bringing the laughter, but he hates being laughed at or mocked. Like with Batman, when you mock him, you make him silly.”</p><p><strong>Please scroll down for more.</strong></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hloKGuur%2BMo6aknaJisrex0bJkmpukpL9uw8eoqmaon6fBs63YnptmrJiaeqOt06aYp2WmnrmtrcinZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-bts-and-blackpink-fans-hate-each-other-so-much-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Do BTS and BLACKPINK Fans Hate Each Other So Much?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-tyson-vs-evander-holyfield-who-has-the-higher-net-worth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Has the Higher Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
