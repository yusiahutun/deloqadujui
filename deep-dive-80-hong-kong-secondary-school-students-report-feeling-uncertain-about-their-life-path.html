The job could provide financial stability but would mean a lot of stress and pressure, whereas lying flat might not provide success but could help you be more relaxed.</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><strong type=strong><span type=text>2.</span></strong><span type=text> Many of the young people who responded to the survey might struggle to find direction in life because of the pressure they face to secure a high-paying job. Hong Kong’s education system is known for putting stress on students, so they might be tempted to “lie flat” because it seems like the best way to preserve their mental well-being.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Issue</span></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>1.</span></strong><span type=text> A</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><strong type=strong><span type=text>2.</span></strong><span type=text> According to the survey cited in Issue, young people in Hong Kong are lying flat because of the long wait time for affordable homes / limited job opportunities / lack of upwards mobility / huge educational expenses / inability to take part in public policy (any two). I somewhat disagree with Cheung’s analysis in News because the survey from Issue shows that self-identity is not a primary factor in lying flat. Instead, for many low-income youth, lying flat is related to how helpless they feel in their economic situations.

This will encourage them and help them feel like their hard work will pay off and eventually, allow them to have a more comfortable life.

As inflation soars, the same amount of money buys fewer goods. Many Hongkongers’ salaries cannot keep up with rising prices. They must work even harder to buy a home, pay for education, or manage their everyday expenses. Many young people might resort to lying flat because working hard still won’t be enough to bring financial stability.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7y56Yq6ZfobKivs2ipaBloprAsMHRnJysZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGpmZYFyhY6dnJ6oXZm2t7GMcWdmoJ%2BjtG63zqeeZquVmLyvsMCrsGark528sLiMrKuunJWjwbR50Z6nqKqkYrOmscuipaBlpaOwpr7TmqCnZZGXvLbAjK2fnqGiYrmqssRmp5qsmA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skinny-syrups.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make Your Own Skinny Syrups</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julia-garner-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of The Ozark Actress Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
