A curiosity whichever way you slice it, Animal World features a maniacal clown battling bizarre CGI monsters, Michael Douglas flying his super-villain freak flag, and intermittent maths lectures to explain possible strategies in a huge, deadly tournament of rock-scissors-paper. There’s some narrative logic girding the whole unlikely structure, but it’s a wilfully eccentric mix. Imagine a YouTube video mashup of ultraviolent manga, David Fincher’s Douglas-starrer The Game from 1997, and a TED talk about game theory – except that description risks making this sound like more fun to watch than it is, especially given the bloated two-hour-plus running time.</description></item><item><title>Booker T.

Character, not circumstances, makes the man. This powerful quote by Booker T. Washington encapsulates the idea that it is not our external circumstances that define us, but rather the content of our character. It highlights the significance of one's integrity, values, and moral fiber in shaping who they truly are. In a straightforward interpretation, this quote emphasizes that our reactions and choices in the face of adversity, rather than the adversity itself, determine our character.</description></item><item><title>Jeremy Lin says my responsibility after Steelers Taiwanese P.
