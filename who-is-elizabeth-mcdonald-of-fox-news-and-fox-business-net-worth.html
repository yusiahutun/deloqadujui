She covered stock market stories and earnings news. She was also the brains behind the now highly rated annual Forbes list “The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women”.</p><p>From Forbes, Lizy joined Fox Television Network in 2007 as a stock editor. In addition to her work as Stock Editor, she hosted all Fox news programs and the Fox Business Show. Through her show, Elizabeth has succeeded in encouraging Americans of all classes, especially the low-income earners, to get a financial education. She educates them about how to use their income for savings and investment purposes.
