Scott Porter is an impressive beat boxer</strong></p><p>The actor, who currently stars on The CW's <strong>"Hart of Dixie,"</strong> couldn't resist showing off some his beatboxing prowess when he took the mic for the press conference. Apparently, it's something he does often -- see his skills above!</p><p><strong>2.) Matt Saracren felt up Grandma!</strong></p><p><strong>Louanne Stephens</strong>, who played "Grandma Saracen" on the show, described an incredibly awkward day of filming with her on-screen grandson (played by <strong>Zach Gilford</strong>).</p><p>While shooting a scene when she jumped out of a car, Louanne says Matt "grabbed my left breast and I know he was hoping that I would let it go and I almost did ... but then I stood up and said 'Zach, what was that?! You grabbed my left breast!' He turned so red."</p><p><strong>3.) Some habits are hard to break</strong></p><p><strong>Connie Britton</strong> had the entire audience cracking up after she called out her TV husband for accidentally addressing <strong>Scott Porter</strong> by his character's name, "Jason," during the press conference.</p><p><strong>4.) Mae Whitman is a "FNL" superfan</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f7/o/2013/06/12/f7918f5dc17c590d804a3472e58da1b0_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>During the press conference, the <strong>"Arrested Development"</strong> and <strong>"Parenthood"</strong> star was the first one to ask a question from the audience. She then got a photo with Britton backstage and was even given a "Friday Night Lights" birthday cake!</p><p><strong>5.) Street & Saracen were roomies</strong></p><p>Even though they barely had any scenes together during the first season, actors Zach Gilford and Scott Porter were roommates off the set in Austin.</p><p><strong>6.) Kyle Chandler is a trooper</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/04/o/2013/06/12/04beb9b71dc15b388f8a9144efdb0276_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong></strong>While the cast was filming the Season 1 finale, Kyle was sick to his stomach -- but he didn't let it affect him on set. "I found you in the bathroom throwing up," writer-director David Hudgins said to Chandler during the panel. "You came out and you did the scene anyway, so thank you for that!"</p><p><strong>7.) Scott Porter is a cry baby</strong></p><p>Just because he was in the show, doesn't mean it doesn't make him cry just as much as the rest of us. The actor teared up during a public screening of the "State" episode and was seen wiping his eyes after watching an emotional scene between himself, <strong>Minka Kelly</strong> and <strong>Taylor Kitsch</strong> during the panel.</p><p><strong>8.) But Scott will also break your foot!</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bd/o/2013/06/12/bd1961b649fd5f94b459ac722b49a446_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>He may be a softy, but the buff actor also revealed he seriously injured one of the crew members on accident. "I broke the camera operators foot" he said, telling the crowd he hit her with a bench. "She [still] finished shooting the scene," Porter added.</p><p><strong>9.) The cast is full of thieves</strong></p><p>Which star couldn't help himself from stealing his character's State ring from the set? Check out the video above.</p><p><strong>10.) Don't hold your breath for a movie</strong></p><p>"We can dream the dream, there have been talks about making a movie of the series," said Hudgins. "The producers are very passionate about it, I don't think there are any plans to move forward right now ... but never say never."</p><p><strong>Bonus Clip:</strong></p><p>What does the cast think their characters are up to day? See who made it big and who's hoping for "new medication" in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7j29mampfm7%2BqsMCyZKehl53BbrjIoJ%2Btq12pv6rCyJpkq52lo7awuoympq%2BhlWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alicia-rickter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alicia Rickter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ray-armstrong-model.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ray Armstrong (Model) dating?
