Ice Spice joined other star-studded guests in a VIP suite to watch the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>, but it was her cross necklace that caused as much of a stir than the results. Standing next to <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, she was in the luxury suite with Travis’ family and friends cheering them on. Although she didn’t get <a href=#>‘squished’ like Lana Del Rey did</a>, eagle-eyed football fans weren’t happy.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ice-spice-s-cross-chain-necklace-upsets-super-bowl-fans>Ice Spice’s cross chain necklace upsets Super Bowl fans</h2><p>The reason viewers were so upset, is because they saw Ice Spice wearing an upside-down cross, with <a href=#>Twitter</a> users claiming it was bringing ‘bad energy’ and called it ‘creepy’.</p><p>The upside-down cross has been used as an anti-Christian and Satanic symbol in the past, but what fans don’t realize is that it’s also an accessory in <a href=#>fashion</a>, just because some people use this symbol, doesn’t mean Ice Spice and others are as well.</p><p>The Cross of Saint Peter is an inverted Latin cross, also upside down, and that represents Christianity. But it’s only been in recent times when the inverted cross has been linked to Satanism. Therefore, not all occurrences of an upside-down cross definitely send an anti-Christian message.</p><p>Despite this, because of popular culture, many thought the celebrity was sending this message – when in reality, she was just dressed in a killer ‘fit. It was <a href=# rel=nofollow>designed</a> by Alex Moss, and a BACKR99MS Concept Chain.</p><p>Not only that, but it may have been a good luck charm, because the Kansas City Chiefs beat the 49ers 25-22 in overtime. Mecole Hardman’s touchdown helped reveal the champions with just three seconds left in the game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-slam-creepy-necklace>Fans slam ‘creepy’ necklace</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1996270375-1024x682.jpg><p>Some music listeners weren’t impressed, as one posted on Twitter: “Ewwww… I see a creepy thing…”</p><p>While another wrote: “I’m glad I spent 0 minutes watching the SuperBowl this weekend!”</p><p>Although one user wasn’t sure what he could see: “Ice spice’s cross looks upside down?”</p><p>But one fan joked: “Ice Spice wearing chain she purchased,” with scared face emojis. Highlighting it’s just fashion.</p><p>A second echoed: “Aww y’all gon cry?!?!? Omg an inverted cross.”</p><p>And a third added: “Nothing like hating on someone I don’t know to start my morning.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-celebrities-flock-to-watch-the-super-bowl>Celebrities flock to watch the Super Bowl</h2><p>The singer had performed at a Super Bowl party the night before for soda brand Starry.</p><p>But the event was attended by an array of Hollywood stars, including <a href=#>Blake Lively</a>, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Beyoncé.</p><p>It comes after <a href=#>Jay-Z spoke out over Beyoncé never winning Album of the Year</a> at the Grammys, despite being the most decorated artist at the awards show.</p><p>Also, <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s adorable first words</a> to each other after the game is pure couple goals. It seems the tight end managed to release all that anger he had when he was seen <a href=#>shouting at Coach Andy Reid</a> on the sidelines.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2Z%2FcL%2FUqZyrZZKkxK15yJycZqugnrCmv4ycqZ6doK56trzSopueZZSkxK95wqumrKtdqr20sdOsZJ%2BZnqh6o8HTZqCtq12jvLV506GYrWWUmrKxew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./passfab-computer-management.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 6 Best Ways to Fix a Computer Stuck on Restarting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-cowell-mum-death-anniversary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Cowell's brother Tony remembers mum on death anniversary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
