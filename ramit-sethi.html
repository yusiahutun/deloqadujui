Ramit’s writing style is engaging, witty, and relatable, which makes it easy for readers to understand complex financial concepts.</p><h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3><p>Ramit Sethi was born on June 30, 1982, in California. Sethi is the son of two Indian immigrants who founded Pavlok, a company that produces wearable technology to help people break bad habits and form good ones.

This incident made him realize that well-known advice on managing finances was not very useful and that there was much more to it than what met the eye.</p><p>Ramit decided to embark on a journey of learning about personal finance and started reading extensively on the topic. He also tried teaching some classes on personal finance to his peers at Stanford but didn’t receive any feedback from them initially. However, things took a turn when he launched his website “IWillTeachYoutoBeRich,” which gained immense popularity among people looking for practical advice on managing their money effectively.</p><p>After graduating, Ramit got an opportunity to work with one of the most renowned marketing gurus – Seth Godin. During this time, he honed his skills in marketing and gained valuable professional experience working alongside industry experts.
