Despite initial apprehensions about the pet's fur, he acquiesced when Giabiconi assured him that cats "take care of themselves". He ended up enjoying his time with Choupette so much that Giabiconi let him keep her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Soon after the adoption, Choupette went viral, as V Magazine editor-in-chief (and Lagerfeld's good friend) Stephen Gan officially introduced her as Lagerfeld's new cat on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/karl-lagerfeld-got-a-kitten data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Twitter class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Twitter</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My love for little furballs came to me quite late," Lagerfeld told Numéro in an interview conducted in French in July 2016. "I had dogs before in my life, but that was when I lived in the countryside. In Paris, as in all big cities, it's always a bit complicated. As you can imagine, I can no longer afford to walk a dog down the street without it bordering on a riot. And then a dog is far from clean and spotless, and when it rains, it smells of dead rats. I had two friends who owned a cat, and they always did loads for them in the overflowing kind of affection, so much so that I found it frankly ridiculous. Well, now I'm much worse."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, Lagerfeld told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/choupette-karl-lagerfeld-cat-scli-intl/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">CNN</a> that he would marry the feline if it were legal. "There is no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals," he said. "I never thought I would fall in love like this with a cat."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She is celebrity-acquainted</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thanks to her late legendary owner, Choupette has been in the presence of many influential figures over the years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kim Kardashian shared several selfies on Instagram of her spending time with the feline in Lagerfeld's office. "Had a date with <a href=# role=link tabindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/choupetteofficiel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@choupetteofficiel class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@choupetteofficiel</a> in Paris," the shapewear mogul wrote. "We then spent some time at <a href=# role=link tabindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/karllagerfeld/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@karllagerfeld class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@karllagerfeld</a>’s office to get a little inspiration for the Met."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She is among the world's most opulent cats</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The designer's beloved Burmese has lived a lifestyle nearly as luxurious and chic as his, and following his death, she is rumoured to inherit a portion of Lagerfeld's €200 million net worth. Though, shockingly, that does not make her the richest cat in the world (Taylor Swift's Scottish Fold, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Tb8N4DyKM/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=abdddd60-3742-4aae-9b73-3d3dc39b398a" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Olivia Benson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Olivia Benson</a>, beats her with a reported worth of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businesstoday.in/visualstories/industry/worlds-richest-pets-taylor-swifts-cats-net-worth-rs-800-cr-equalling-ranbir-alias-combined-net-worth-17538-09-01-2023 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$97 million" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">$97 million</a>), she is certainly still among the wealthiest, and is arguably the favourite within the fashion world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout her lifetime, the booked-and-busy feline has graced several magazine covers—including that of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a26188/karl-lagerfeld-choupette-and-i/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper's Bazaar UK" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Harper's Bazaar UK</a> in 2013 — and even had her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/07/karl-lagerfeld-cat-choupette-makeup-book data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="own line of make-up and a book" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">own line of make-up and a book</a> about her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has travelled by private jet, alongside a handful of bodyguards, agents, chefs, and personal assistants. And she dined across from Lagerfeld every evening, during their time together, in the designer's Paris apartment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lagerfeld told Numéro in 2016: "Now that she is an adult, she eats at the table with me. She sits across from me and only eats what she needs to eat. Before, she used to attack a shrimp, but now she only touches her four different dishes that are prepared for her the same day, served in lovely bowls. Everything has to be fresh, otherwise, Mademoiselle sits in front of her croquettes in sauce for three-quarters of an hour, giving me murderous looks, without touching them."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She still lives a lavish life in Paris</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 11-year-old Burmese currently lives in Paris and is now owned by Lagerfeld's former housekeeper, Françoise Caçot, who has since dropped her nanny role to care for the feline full-time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Caçot currently runs the feline's verified Instagram page, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/choupetteofficiel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@choupetteofficiel class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@choupetteofficiel</a>, which has racked up more than 150K followers. The active account regularly features snapshots of Choupette in her day-to-day life, plus throwback moments with Lagerfeld (many shot from the designer's phone) — and captions meant to be first-person notes from "Choupette" capturing her point of view on anything and everything.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just as Lagerfeld would have wanted, Choupette continues to live a pampered lifestyle under Caçot's care. The cat's 11th birthday was celebrated last August on a private jet with balloons and champagne.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1qcGtlaYVxe8qaqaVlnJa0pr7FnqOdZZOWwW6vx6isqZ2kqbJussCcq6xlnJ6zpnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julianne-hough-epitomizes-chic-gorgeous-mini-dress-sheer-stockings.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julianne Hough epitomizes chic in gorgeous mini dress and sheer stockings</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cameron-hanes-wiki-height-age-net-worth-family-2019.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cameron Hanes Wiki, Height, Age, Net Worth, Family In 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
