She thanked residents for their support.</p><p>“We congratulate the mayor and his win, but 49 percent of citizens voted for a new direction,” said co-campaign manager Kevin Dearmon. “There is still a divide in the city of Laurel.”</p><p>Dearmon said in four years, Beard could consider another run at the mayor.</p><p>“While we don’t know what the future holds, this will not be the last time Laurel sees Miranda involved in politics,” Dearmon said. “We still have a long way to go to help those who may have feel forgotten in this city or left behind.”</p><p>Kim Page finished third with 328 votes and Anthony Hudson finished fourth with 93.</p><p>In the City Council Ward 1 race, incumbent Independent Rev.

His goals for the city include continuing infrastructure improvements and running a fiscally responsible administration.</p><p>“I’m appreciative and thankful for everyone who came out, and now it’s time to continue on,” Buckhaults said. “We’ve got some projects ongoing right now in the works — the downtown project and a few others we need an engineer on.”</p><p>Buckhaults said he appreciates those who voted for him and he looks forward to serving Ellisville another four years.</p><p>Lindsey, 24, is working on his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice at William Carey University. Lindsey is an Ellisville native who graduated from South Jones High School.</p><p>Lindsey said although he was not successful in the race, he “made them sweat.”</p><p>“We put some fire under them,” Lindsey said. “We didn’t win — we didn’t pretty much lose. I believe that, prayerfully, this has awakened the people. I’ve learned through this election that a majority of our city does not know much about the political process.”</p><p>In the Ward 1 Alderman race, Jeffrey Williams defeated Dominique Evans 111-24. Ola Mitchell won another term as alderman-at-large by defeating Lisa Marsh Rogers 329-192.
