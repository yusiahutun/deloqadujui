Alternatively, members can opt to earn money on their current investment piece, sitting idly in their wardrobes, offering members a new way to invest and monetise their wardrobe.</p><p id=eNfdr5RuaLv8 data-wc=104>"Before founding Covett, I spent over 20 years working with global brands on strategic organisational transformations. I have always been a lover of jewellery and luxury goods and its power to imbue confidence in women. I believe more and more people are understanding the power and values of 'Covettism', specifically being more conscious consumers by adopting sharing and circular economy models."&nbsp;explains Cynthia Morrow, Founder at Covett, "By partnering with Front Row London we can take the next step in our journey, as we add designer bags, along with our gorgeous jewellery to our co-ownership model, offering more luxury goods in a circular way."</p><p id=eepcKXAJNy4N data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Delvaux: Why celebrities and Belgian Royals are obsessed with this heritage handbag brand</a></strong></p><p id=eopAvB1S9GH8 data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>eBay is launching a service to make sure you aren’t buying fake designer bags</a></p><p id=eWrl9qi8R3vx><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49aadac5c58e-covett2-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=e-kGBee2zlvQ data-wc=14><strong>You can reserve the bag you have invested in to wear during the year</strong></p><p id=eXdc9_o96KIo data-wc=93>Covett launched to redefine wealth by sharing the value in fine jewellery. Their smart ownership model allows co-owners to wear their jewellery pieces every month at a fraction of the cost compared to the purchase price. Meanwhile Front Row London is the UK’s premiere destination for on-demand luxury goods, granting you instant access to rent the latest pieces, straight off the runway from the world’s most in demand designers. Founder, Shika Bodani launched the brand in 2016 as a new way to monetise wardrobes through lending clothes and re-investing in new wardrobe staples.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekrL7iIkZzJs data-wc=77>"We wanted to bring together the world of fashion and finance in a way to empower women by giving them an opportunity to invest in assets they wouldn't have been given the opportunity to invest in previously."&nbsp;Front Row founder, Shika Bodani explains of the new initiative, "Whether it is for investment purposes or simply to enjoy wearing the bag, we are allowing our clients to rotate and co-own multiple bags, all for the price of one."</p><p id=enT3U3tIC3G5 data-wc=66>The newly launched Circular Luxury Club allows its members to have their beloved pieces to be co-owned with like-minded individuals, offering "more investment than the original price."&nbsp; This new innovative model offers a unique approach to a circular wardrobe, allowing members to own a share in their desired luxury handbags and fine jewellery, with other luxury lovers, to enjoy for up to ten weeks per year.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIHg8EVG1IwM data-wc=84>During that process, members will have the ability to borrow items and lend items to other members for a fee, thereby expanding their luxury access. When all co-owners have been secured, co-owners will be able to schedule 10 weeks throughout the year to enjoy the luxury item. The schedule dates are available up to 90 days in advance and can be scheduled for 1-4 week intervals. During your schedule dates, your luxury item will be delivered and collected on a specific date and time.</p><p id=eftvJBc1t2l3 data-wc=73>The Front Row and Covett Circular Luxury Club also acts as a full concierge service, providing logistics, cleaning, maintenance, repair and insurance, to ensure the item remains in pristine condition for each co-owner. As a member of the club, clients will have exclusive access to new items and shares as they come up for sale. The Club aims to create a trusted and safe community, with each member going through a vetting process.</p><p id=eY9123Hrla0v data-wc=35>Despite the cost-of-living crisis, luxury shoppers are still looking for designer goodies &nbsp;with co-ownership shares starting from 20 percent it feels like a good time to finally 'invest'&nbsp;in that Saddle Bag you've always wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=ehEr89Ps94lS data-wc=10></p><p id=eeLDEMGhswZ4 data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWtpYWWAcoGUcmlyZ5anvK%2FAjKumsGWcpLulu81mmqiulanBbq%2FIq5qupJGneq3B166psmWTocKjew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-big-bad-budget-battle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Pioneer Woman' Ree Drummond Has a New TV Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-trying-too-hard-be-happy-can-make-you-miserable-and.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why trying too hard to be happy can make you miserable, and how to deal with negative emotions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
