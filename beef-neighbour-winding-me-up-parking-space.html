He has got 4x4.</p><p>“The spaces here are not built for 4x4s in any way, shape or form. Your car don't fit.</p><p>“It literally touches the line's either side.”</p><p>Not only this, but Issy claimed that the man has also let his girlfriend park in the car park too, as she added: “Next thing, after telling him, he lets his girlfriend park in the car park. Now babe, you're asking for problems.</p><p>“One day I came back from Manchester. I had been there in the car for five and a half hours.&nbsp;</p><p>“I come back and guess who's in my space.</p><p>“I put in the group chat ‘hey, can you move your car out of my space?’</p><p>“He was like, ‘no.’ Sorry, did you just say no? Did you do that?”</p><p>Issy claimed that she has confronted the man many times about the parking issue, as she continued: “I ran downstairs, I swear to God, I was in a dressing gown, nothing else.</p><p>“I [hit] on the door like the <a href=#>police</a> were about to raid him. And I went, ‘get out of my space’.</p><p>“He was like, ‘can you not come into my flat?’</p><p>“I've told you already. Don't p**s me off and take the p**s because I'm a young woman, because they love to take the p**s out of us young women. Only women know this pain.&nbsp;</p><p>“He tried to slam the door, so I put my phone runner in between the gap.</p><p>“I said, ‘you're in my space, I'm now in yours. Now can you move your car?’</p><p>“He did. He did in fact move his car.</p><p>“But you think the war is over - wrong.”</p><p>Not only this, but Issy claimed that her neighbour also does something just to annoy her, as she claimed: “He now parks diagonally in the bay every single f*****g day to p**s me off.</p><p>“The woman who divorced him? Yeah. All I'm saying is, well done. You made the right decision.</p><p>“This seems like such a first world problem, but why? Why do I live this life?&nbsp;</p><p>“I'm having a war with a 50 year old man. My man's <a href=#>hair</a> started receding before I was even born.”&nbsp;</p><p>When asked “Is it designated bays???”, Issy later explained: “Depends, I’ve purchased so mine came with my flat, he’s rented so has no designated bay.”</p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> clip, which was posted under the username @<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">issyoakley</a>, has clearly left many open-mouthed, as it has quickly amassed 339,800 views.</p><p>Social media users were in hysterics at the clip and many took to the comments to express this.</p><p>One person said: “I love these stories. I’m already in stitches.”</p><p>In response, Issy confirmed: “I have beef with the other old man in the building too, so I have plenty more.”</p><p>Another added: “When someone parks in my space I park behind them and block them in.”</p><p>To this, Issy claimed: “I wish I could do this but I’d also block in half the car park.”</p><p>A third commented: ”Daily I have the same issue.”</p><p>Meanwhile, someone else shared: “Worst thing about flats is people stealing your parcels!!!”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>To this, Issy then penned: “DON'T GET ME STARTED.”</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
