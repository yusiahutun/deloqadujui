There was also the question of who bore more star power in the relationship:&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Oscar</a>-winning Roberts or Lovett's hair?

Walters asked, "Do you like your husband's hair?" to which Roberts responded, "I do like his hair," adding that it was "not as big as everyone makes it out to be. It's pretty normal." OK, glad it was sorted that America's Sweetheart&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;jealous of her then-beau's infamous 'do.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1992-julia-roberts-and-lyle-lovett-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1992: Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett first meet</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though both Roberts and Lovett appeared in Robert Altman's 1992 film&nbsp;The Player, and many attribute their introduction to that set, Roberts told Walters in 1993 that she and Lovett met through mutual friends.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Per&nbsp;Esquire</a>, she was reportedly a fan of his music before they were introduced and would listen to the singer's "tapes" (this was the early '90s, yes) in the car.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-june-1993-julia-roberts-and-lyle-lovett-get-married></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>June 1993: Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett get married</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Kagan/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Roberts and Lovett began dating in early June 1993 and surprised the media-consuming universe when they wed in a small Indiana town later that month, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People&nbsp;reported</a>. She was 25 years old, and he was 35.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Roberts returned to the set of&nbsp;The Pelican Brief&nbsp;following her wedding, the cast and crew (including co-star Denzel Washington) threw her a party in which they all wore shirts that read: "He’s A Lovely Boy … But You Really Must Do Something About His Hair" on the back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the fanfare around their relationship and hair, Lovett and Roberts did an admirable job of making their union seem traditional. They had the classic church wedding (which they'd only begun planning 72 hours prior and was squeezed between Lovett's tour dates and Roberts's filming schedule).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bride walked down the aisle barefoot in a white Commes des Garçons gown, purchased by Lovett, with a tulle scarf instead of a veil.

Is that a felony?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, given the nature of their careers, it was impossible to not have to spend time apart.

"You'd think people who could be that nice to each other would probably be a couple, but it just sort of wasn't the way it was intended to be. We found our little niche and then overstepped it a little bit. In fact, I think it can just as often be the weaker choice to stay."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of 1997, Lovett still called Roberts's mother "mom,"&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>according to&nbsp;People</a>, and the actress later described her marriage to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>New York Daily News</a>&nbsp;as simply a "miscalculation."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Never a mistake.
