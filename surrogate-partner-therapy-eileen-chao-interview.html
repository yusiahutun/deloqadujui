With five years of experience under her belt, an M.A. in psychology with an emphasis on counseling, and certificates in a range of somatic (experiential) psychology, Chao, who is poly, kink, LGBTQ+, and sex work affirming, has helped hundreds of clients overcome trauma via her private practice in San Francisco.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Commonly misunderstood and somewhat controversial, surrogate partner therapy is often wrongly grouped with sex work, mostly because of an overall lack of published research and because of its absence in the national discourse surrounding alternative therapies. While sex work functions to offer sexual gratification to a client, surrogate partner work focuses on helping a client overcome the physical, social, and emotional traumas that prohibit them from achieving healthy intimacy and sexual satisfaction with both partners and themselves. As defined by the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.surrogatetherapy.org/what-is-surrogate-partner-therapy/what-is-surrogate-partner-therapy-2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="International Professional Surrogates Association" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">International Professional Surrogates Association</a> (IPSA), surrogate partner therapy is a three-way therapeutic relationship between a licensed therapist, a client, and a surrogate partner. A licensed therapist can simply offer advice or a potential solution to a client regarding intimacy, whereas a surrogate partner is charged with actualizing it. Sex coaching, on the other hand, does not involve a licensed therapist and focuses heavily on education.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to multiple studies, surrogate partner therapy has been proven successful in a wide range of cases that involve people who experience anxiety about physical and emotional intimacy—from women diagnosed with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S174360951531585X?via%3Dihub data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=vaginismus class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">vaginismus</a> and men <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498809551423 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dealing class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dealing</a> with erectile dysfunction to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2011.620454 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=people class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">people</a> who are confused about their sexuality.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Given how COVID-19 has altered the ways in which we connect socially, sexually, and otherwise, Chao has had to drastically alter her approach and transition largely to virtual work during a time when touch and intimacy are lacking more than ever. And with the recent rise in acts of violence against the AAPI community, many of which have occurred in her city of residence, Chao, who is Asian-American, has had to increasingly balance tending to her own mental health and supporting her clients in these times.</p><img alt="eileen chao" title="eileen chao" width=2000 height=1880 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-6076-r-1619192338.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Eileen Chao</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the phone, BAZAAR.com speaks with Chao about the importance of making intimacy accessible, the differences between surrogate partner therapy and sex coaching, and what we can glean from the Atlanta massage parlor shootings when it comes to the importance of destigmatizing sex work.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How were you first introduced to surrogate partner therapy?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I got into surrogate partner therapy and sex coaching because of my own desire to work on my own body and experiences. None of us are taught that much about sex at all, and like anybody else, I was very interested in sex, feeling pleasure, and my body. But the reality of it was in sexual situations, I wouldn't know how to communicate. I wasn't good at asserting boundaries, and I think a lot of women are socialized in this way to be pleasers. We know how to act sexy, but not actually feel that in our bodies. We know how to perform, and satisfaction typically comes from satisfying our partners. I'm mostly speaking from my own experience as a mostly straight person who has sexual experiences with men, but it was just something that I really wanted to work on within myself. I wanted to have better sexual experiences, and the challenge of that was confronting all the ways that I was socialized and raised.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've also always been interested in psychology, but I didn't want to become a talk therapist. Talk therapy is really important and plays such an important role in healing. But for some people, surrogate partner therapy allows people to put into practice the things they've been talking about. Additionally, it brings up things within to explore more with your therapist, rather than just the people in your life. When you're with a person that you're dating, things can get really messy, and this work allows you to just focus on you and have space to just dive into all the things that you want to work on.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Because of COVID-19, engaging in physical sessions with your clients wasn’t possible until very recently, as many folks are becoming vaccinated. How did you shift your work to an online medium? Can we hold space in an intimate way virtually?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I definitely find a lot of value and enjoy working in person, but I also realize that the vaccine isn't necessarily accessible to everybody, so I also don't want to exclude people who aren't able to get vaccinated right now. Honestly, it was really hard in the beginning. I don't think this pandemic was something that any of us were prepared for in any way. I became really overwhelmed, because I didn't know how to do this work online. A lot of my clients were also really concerned. But everyone always focuses on the sex aspect and tends to call surrogate partners "sex surrogates," which gives people the impression that this work is all about intercourse. What surrogate therapy really gives people is experiential practice of being in relationship with another person, and that includes emotional intimacy, vulnerability, and healthy communication. I've learned that that work is absolutely possible to do virtually.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I wanted to have better sexual experiences, and the challenge of that was confronting all the ways that I was socialized and raised.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've also recently been doing a lot of sex education, because one of the things that creates barriers to pleasure and causes a lot of anxiety is having unrealistic expectations for your own body and what you think you're supposed to be doing. Pleasure-based, medically accurate sex education is such an important part of the work, and it's able to be taught online. So many of us feel so much shame even just talking about sex. It feels embarrassing or private and requires vulnerability. It takes practice being able to lean into that, where it becomes easier and the barriers to actually engaging with somebody in person are eliminated. We—my clients and I—also get to practice how we communicate a boundary and ask for the things that we want.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What are the major similarities and differences between surrogate partner therapy and sex coaching?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They're really similar in the sense that there's an educational foundation and a lot of work around communication. A lot of people that come to me—especially adult virgins or people with really minimal experience—think simply having intercourse fixes everything. But how you have good sex is so much more than just intercourse, so I also do a lot of work with people on having pleasurable experiences not necessarily focused on penetration. We're all socialized to think that intercourse is the main event, so the focus in both sex coaching and surrogate partner therapy is decentering penetration, focusing on pleasure, sex education, explicit communication, and also working on being present and getting out of your head and more into your body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With surrogate partner therapy, though, there's a therapist involved, meaning the therapist, the surrogate, and the client form a three-way team that works together to help the client reach their goals. Some people choose not to see a therapist, so they see me for coaching work, while some people feel like they need the additional support of a therapist. At a certain point, surrogate partner work can also involve nudity to help people get comfortable being seen, touched, and get better familiar with genitalia, which can be a big barrier for people. Some surrogates do have sexual experiences with their clients. My clients might eventually feel comfortable if they have sex with me, but they need the skills to be able to self-regulate so they're comfortable no matter who they're with and what situation they're in. So that's more of what I'm focused on.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What kinds of issues do you treat most?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Everyone I see has anxiety—performance anxiety or just general social anxiety that makes it difficult for them to connect with other people. So much of that is a result of a lack of proper sex education and all of these unrealistic expectations on your own body. I also work with a lot of people who grew up religious, and I've found that people who were raised religious or really conservative never really got to feel comfortable with their bodies. Ultimately, it's all about getting people in touch with their internal sense of what feels right and wrong, as a lot of people haven't had opportunities to really develop that inner barometer.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What are the most fulfilling aspects of this work? The most challenging?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's so fulfilling when someone comes to the realization that they're normal. I work with a range of people who are in their 20s, 30s, 60s, 70s who maybe have been in minimal relationships or have never been in a relationship, and it's really fulfilling for me to see them have the experience of touching and being touched. Touch is such an important human need, and it's something a lot of us don't get enough of, if at all. Even just seeing the benefits of that, getting them to lean into their desires and connect with their bodies is really rewarding.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The challenging part for me has been my own personal issues around boundaries. It's challenging for me to assert boundaries, and in this profession, I want to help people and do everything right, but some of those things come up against my own boundaries. Part of my job is to be a model for my clients, so I have to show them it's not only okay to say no but also what to do when you have to say no and potentially disappoint your partner. I'm trying to show them how to hold space without disappointment, which is probably the biggest challenge.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It often feels like as a society, we’re sex obsessed yet aren’t having productive, meaningful conversations about it. Why is it so hard for us to engage with comprehensive sex education and therapy, and work toward the implementation and normalization of it?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I would say it's a few different things. First of all, I think because what is pleasurable and what turns us on is so personal that it can feel very vulnerable. There's always a chance you tell your partner what you prefer and they react in a bad way. That can feel like a rejection of something so personal. I think gender roles that have been ingrained in us all also play a part. Many men that I work with feel pressured to have to do certain things that maybe they don't even necessarily like, or they secretly like things they feel aren't masculine. Men feel like they have to prove themselves, while women are socialized to focus solely on their partner's satisfaction. I think both leave us in this space where we're not allowed to be sexual, because it's bad, but then we're also supposed to be super open and experienced. How are we to get experience when there's this much pressure?</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Men feel like they have to prove themselves, while women are socialized to focus solely on their partner’s satisfaction.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Just weeks ago, a gunman </strong><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=murdered class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><strong>murdered</strong></a><strong> eight people in three Atlanta massage parlors. There have been many questions surrounding this tragedy, especially whether or not the six Asian women employed at the parlors were, in fact, sex workers. Though your work is not inherently sex work, what takeaways do you think the national discourse is missing?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think this just goes to show we as a society have a long way to go. The only reason that I even have a job is because there's so much shame and denial of a basic human need, which is sex, pleasure, and receiving touch. I feel we try so hard to distance ourselves from these very natural desires and impulses, and that denial just creates so much unhealthiness, anxiety, and pathologizing of ourselves. I hope that this at least creates more conversations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, if I had any control of anything, the most important thing to happen is to decriminalize sex work and implement medically accurate, pleasure-based sex education. Only <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/sex-education/sex-education-laws-and-state-attacks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="15 states" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">15 states</a> in the country mandate medically accurate sex education. We're traumatizing young people in school about a very natural thing that their body experiences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I also feel like it's not anyone's place to say or speculate if the victims were sex workers or just working there in another capacity, because it's so stigmatized and still illegal. If any of those people had survived and were outed, they could potentially lose custody of their children, and their ability to maintain or procure secure housing could be impacted for the rest of their life. I feel like that aspect wasn't really part of the conversation. It's an important part of how much sex workers are stigmatized and how having that identifier can really prevent them from accessing so many things—from surviving at all.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It’s worth noting that the gunman </strong><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/03/19/robert-aaron-long-evangelical-treatment-facility-sex-addiction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><strong>said</strong></a><strong> that he carried out the shooting because he has a sex addiction. Had he accessed the type of therapy you offer, is there a chance he could’ve been helped?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, actually. I think it's really important to recognize that he comes from an evangelical religion and in evangelicalism, sex addiction and porn addiction mean very different things for non-evangelicals. Even thinking about watching porn counts as sex addiction or porn addiction in that religion. Wanting to have sex outside of a heterosexual marriage also counts as a porn addiction or sex addiction. So, of course, that played a role. I want to note that it's not addiction if it's something that you enjoy. Wanting to feel pleasure in our bodies is a part of being human.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How has your experience as an Asian-American surrogate partner therapist been affected by the rise in AAPI hate? Have you been able to tend to your own mental health and emotional well-being?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'm definitely putting in the work to take care of myself. I have my own therapists that I work with and different self-care practices, so I really just take the time to make sure that I'm prioritizing myself. In terms of taking care of myself where it pertains to my clients, I trust my own intuition and any gut feelings that come up. If I get a new client inquiry that doesn't sit right with me, I won't respond. Of course, I'm privileged in the sense that I can afford to turn people down and not accept every inquiry. But I have to trust my instincts in terms of protecting myself and my boundaries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/6f6a776d-f4a6-4513-ac74-69e858c9faed_1645027149.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Audra Heinrichs" title="Headshot of Audra Heinrichs" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Audra Heinrichs is a freelance feature writer and reporter, covering social justice, politics and cultural moments and movements.
