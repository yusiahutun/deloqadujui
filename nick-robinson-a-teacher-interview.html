The actor has been playing high school students for a full decade, beginning with a four-season run on ABC Family sitcom Melissa & Joey and concluding (or so he hopes) with FX on Hulu miniseries A Teacher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, Robinson vowed to end his journey as a perpetual teen after playing the eponymous Simon Spier in coming-of-age film Love, Simon. "I've graduated, hopefully," he told Ellen DeGeneres in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2018 interview</a>, "and won't be going back."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, it wasn't long before A Teacher nullified Robinson's promise, returning him to the world of pep rallies and study sessions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hoped that no one would watch that interview where I said that I would never play high school again," he tells me over Zoom with a laugh, looking rugged and definitely over-18 in an unpretentious 66˚North beanie and flannel shirt. "I'd made that ultimatum, and then I read the scripts for the series, and I met with [creator Hannah Fidell] and Kate [Mara], and I kind of went, 'Shit, one more.'"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sandy Kim</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robinson joins our call from British Columbia, where he's currently filming miniseries Maid opposite Margaret Qualley. We delay the interview for 15 minutes so he can get a COVID-19 test — a process he must undergo three times a week while in production. He tells me he had a mild case of the virus earlier this year, back when he was living in Williamsburg and "doing a play."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That ever-so-casually-noted "play" happens to be Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird on Broadway, aka the "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>highest-grossing American play ever</a>." Judging by our 40 minutes together, 2,500 miles and a computer screen apart, Robinson doesn't strike me as the type of actor who eagerly name-drops his prestigious projects or A-list co-stars. He greets me by name when he comes on screen — a simple act of courtesy that feels largely forgotten in a year marked by hate crimes and awkward interactions made from beneath face coverings. From his unfussy style to his nearly-dormant Instagram account, Robinson seems like an actor committed to just that: acting (and also maybe being a pleasant and approachable person). He takes questions and answers seriously (even when they're about bagel toppings), pausing to find the perfect articulation for the words in his head. The celebrity of it all doesn't appear to be on his radar.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the rare occasions when he has updated his 1.5 million Instagram followers over the past few months, it's been to encourage them to vote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If there's a time to say something, it's now," he tells me, his passion for the topic evident in the minutes-long monologue of sorts that follows. "To be honest, I feel like I should be doing more. There have been a million times where my finger has kind of hovered over 'post' or 'share' and not done it because there is this thing where people would be like, 'Oh, just stick to acting, we don't need to hear your opinions,' but fuck that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With A Teacher, Robinson is able to participate in a project that not only highlights his acting skill, but furthers a conversation. He plays Eric, a high school student who has an affair with his teacher, Claire (Mara). Unlike many of the predecessors who have tread this same cinematic territory, the series is as dedicated to drawing the viewer into the illicit relationship as it is to immersing them in the brutal and enduring aftermath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The show does a little bit of a bait-and-switch on the audience, which is intentional," Robinson explains. "It makes them complicit in Eric and Claire's relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, though, A Teacher's stance on its subject matter is clear. "Everyone involved in this production took this story very seriously. It wasn't to make light of these kinds of relationships. It wasn't to glorify them. It really was to make a character study on what happens to these people after the headlines," he says. "There are a lot of headlines, a lot of clickbait, and there's not a lot of follow-up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The role of Eric wasn't an easy one to play, and the emotional toll was heavy. "That's something that I'm trying to get better at," Robinson said of shrugging his character off at the end of the day. But this particular journey compelled him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was really interested in exploring how male survivors internalized this kind of trauma," he says. "And oftentimes it's really suppressed for years."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The relationship is often used as a kind of social currency for the survivors. They're given high-fives and told 'you're the man' and all that. So, the push and pull of that, of wanting that to be true, but also dealing with some very complicated emotions internally, I think was what a lot of the second half of the show is about: Eric grappling with the reaction of his peers versus what he's actually feeling inside."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, Robinson's research would be for naught if he and Mara didn't have chemistry. Luckily, their connection was instant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robinson extolled Mara's "wicked sense of humor," which came in handy during some of their more "intimate" scenes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sandy Kim</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You kind of have to laugh at some of those scenes when you're doing it," he told me. "If you did a macro view it would just be two people with a bunch of burly grips around and camera operators and lights on you. So it's not actually an intimate experience."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Robinson's still playing high school, the rules have changed. The laugh-tracks have fallen away and the happy endings once found at, say, the top of a ferris wheel, are just out of reach. His performance in A Teacher is a departure from a body of work that tends to skew "teen," but it's a defining one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on below as Robinson tells us his favorite "long and bad" joke, recounts his first kiss, and names his favorite Robert.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What's the last thing you do before you fall asleep?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Honestly, especially recently, the last thing before I do before I fall asleep is check the news and check social media. Probably not healthy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If nothing else, can we please just end this to change the news cycle? Because it's crazy-making. The whole thing is just, it's constant turnovers. I'd just like some peace and quiet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The plotline of 2020 is really insane and implausible. It jumped the shark a long time ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who's your favorite villain?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don Draper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You see him as a villain?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I do. But that's the best part — most of the really good villains have some humanity and are maybe slightly ambiguous, but I think ultimately, yeah, he's a villain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What was the first album you ever owned?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Who Let the Dogs Out" is one of the first songs I really remember having playing, in like kindergarten, so I didn't buy it. But I had a portable CD player, which was really cool. And I had a Roy Orbison Greatest Hits CD that I liked a lot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do you still listen to that?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes. Yeah. I was also a big Elvis fan growing up. A lot of the oldies. And I do still listen to that, but there are newer folks now that I prefer, I guess.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sandy Kim</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What's your favorite cheesy pickup line?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>A classic.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a classic.

It's not something that appeals to me, but I did see a good hat the other day that said "Make Orwell Fiction Again," that I thought was kind of funny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Name one place you've never been but have always wanted to go.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vietnam, I would say, or Thailand.

One day Jim tragically died in a fire. His body was burnt to a crisp. He was unrecognizable. So the coroner asked Billy Bob and Dick to come in to identify the body because they were best friends and walk into town every day together. So Billy Bob shows up to the coroner's office, looks at the body, turns to the coroner and asks him to flip the body over, takes one look and says, "Nope, that's not Jim." And then Dick comes in, asks the coroner to flip the body over. He takes one look. He says, "Nope, that's not Jim." Coroner was flabbergasted by this because there was really no way to identify the body. And he asked Billy Bob, he said, "How do you guys know that this isn't Jim?" Then Billy Bob said, "Well, every day Jim and Dick and I walk into town, everyone says, "Look, here comes Jim with those two assholes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_98-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>That's bad.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's horrible.
