The two may have stepped into the ring as enemies for their infamous 1997 match that ended when Tyson bit off a piece of Holyfield’s ear, but they actually had far more in common than most people realize; both boxers had multiple reigns as heavyweight champion and both made huge sums of money over the course of their career.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_29>However, another thing the former champions have in common is that they both burned through hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to reckless spending, poor financial management, and hangers-on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_26>Tyson and Holyfield both ended up filing for bankruptcy in order to get their finances back under control, but who has the higher net worth today?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-mike-tyson-and-evander-holyfield-made-over-1-billion-in-combined-earnings>Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield made over $1 billion in combined earnings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tyson-holyfield.jpg><p id=par-4_39>In their primes, Tyson and Holyfield were two of the most exciting boxers to watch on TV. They drew huge ratings for pay-per-view providers, and networks paid them ridiculous sums of money for the rights to air their matches.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_42>Even though both boxers earned an unbelievable amount of money over the course of their careers, Tyson earned significantly more than Holyfield. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, Tyson received $400 million from his must-watch boxing matches but also earned another $200 million from endorsements.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_36>Holyfield, on the other hand, earned approximately $560 million in career earnings, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>.
