I suggested Russia, Brazil, India or China - he vetoed all but China. It all happened very quickly and three months later we were in Shanghai and enrolled at Jiaotong University to study Mandarin. It is pretty challenging and I wish I could speak better Mandarin than I do.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We had so much fun there, and I made lots of Chinese girlfriends during those 21/2 years. I had studied fashion management at Leeds University and worked in trend forecasting for The Future Laboratory before moving to Shanghai [in 2008] and did a few projects for them and WGSN [also a trend consultancy].</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I grew up on a farm and as a child I only had a school uniform and my riding kit to wear because my mother hates shopping - but we had a wonderful dressing-up box of my grandmother's and aunts' vintage clothes and I would wear those to parties. I once cut up my grandmother's original '20s flapper dress - which I never forgave myself for doing. I am hopeless at wearing casual clothes and love getting dressed up in long dresses - any excuse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While living in Shanghai I found this amazing tailor. I am six feet tall and when I walked into fashion shops the assistants would say: 'too big, too fat!'. I could see that pyjamas were going to become a big trend and so I got my tailor to make me a couple of pairs in silk. I wore them for my 25th birthday party, to dinners, even walking our dog. I dressed them up, dressed them down and gave them as presents to friends. They adored them and I returned from a trip to England with a huge order list.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My tailor gulped and said, 'I do have other clients'. So I thought maybe this is something I could do properly and set up a brand. I always thought my husband's surname von Halle would make a pretty good brand name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It took 18 months, with my assistant and I driving all over Hangzhou and Suzhou to find silk factories. We launched the collection at London Fashion Week in 2011 and by the following Christmas had built up a solid stockist list including Harrods. The hardest thing of all is having the confidence; fear of failure is very strong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, sales were up last Christmas 100 per cent on the previous year and I have finished a bridal trousseau collection that will launch in March.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coco Chanel introduced silk pyjamas in the 1920s having borrowed them from her lovers. They were the first trousers women wore, going to parties in lounging pyjamas and to the beach in beach pyjamas. I love that era and you still get a great sense of it in Shanghai, which was then known as the Pearl of the Orient.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asia is a huge source of inspiration and for our A/W 2013 campaign I asked my friends, stylist Leaf Greener and photographer Ele Jin, to do the shoot presenting my pyjamas through Chinese eyes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That shoot [photographed in Shanghai's Peace Hotel, which was originally built by one of her husband's ancestors, Victor Sassoon] has been our most popular, and was my way of tackling my critics head on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They couldn't understand why as a luxury brand we were manufacturing in China, but silk comes from China. Chinese silk is the best in the world and I am very proud of the fact that we manufacture there. That shoot was a tribute to that heritage."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlp5bBpLTErGaaqqSesK2xjmpuaWppaoNwsMSsoKCmlad6sLjIr6CaZaaku260wKWjnmWklrmsv4ysoKWjXaXGq63Mmqpmm5%2BYvG6vx5qlnqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-anabelle-acosta-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Anabelle Acosta Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-vacation-homes-in-canada.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities who own vacation homes in Canada</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
