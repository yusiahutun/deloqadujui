We are proud to have received recognition at both the Stevie Awards and the Digiday Europe Awards, highlighting our commitment to excellence in influencer marketing, while also recognizing our forward-thinking mentality that has always been one of our strongest assets throughout our more than 16 years of market presence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At the Stevie Awards, INFLOW Network was recognized for our outstanding work on the “More Than A Final 2023” project with Turkish Airlines. This groundbreaking project involved the world’s first football match between two continents, Europe and Asia, on Istanbul’s Bosphorus with names such as </span><span><a href=#><span>Luisito Comunica</span></a></span><span> (Mexico), </span><span><a href=#><span>Pubity</span></a></span><span> (UK), </span><span><a href=#><span>Noel Goes Crazy</span></a></span><span> (Germany), </span><span><a href=#><span>Tuvok</span></a></span><span> (France), </span><span><a href=#><span>The2Freestylers</span></a></span><span> (UK) during 3 days in Istanbul. The experience blended the city’s rich history with the excitement of the UEFA Champions League final, creating the perfect setting for an influencer marketing-based campaign centered around football.</span></p><p><span>The event, which took place during the final of the UEFA Champions League, featured 20 global influencers and generated over 302 million impressions. The campaign’s success was reflected in its $10.7 million earned media value.</span></p><p><span>The awards won for the “More Than A Final 2023” project at the Stevie Awards include:</span></p><ul><li><span><span><span>Grand Stevie Award (Campaign with the Highest Score of the Year)</span></span></span></li><li><span>3 Gold Stevie Awards</span></li></ul><p>Innovation in Cross-Media Marketing</p><p>Innovation in Sponsorships</p><p>Most Innovative Advertising Agency</p><ul><li><span>3 Silver Stevie Awards</span></li></ul><p>Innovation in Entertainment Events</p><p>Innovation in Event Use</p><p>Innovation in Media, Visual Communication, and Entertainment</p><ul><li><span>4 Bronze Stevie Awards</span></li></ul><p><span>Innovation in Social Media Use</span></p><p>Innovation in Celebrity Use</p><p>Innovation in Branded Entertainment</p><p>Innovation in Content Marketing / Branded Content</p><p><span>Additionally, at the Digiday Europe Awards, INFLOW Network was honored with the “Best Event” award, also for our “More Than A Final 2023” project with Turkish Airlines, a category that celebrates the strategic, creative, and seamless execution of events in both ATL and BTL formats. This award adds to our list of achievements, as we were also nominated within the same category for our “#ComeToIstanbul: World Cup Diary with IGA” project with IGA Istanbul Airport. This project celebrated the FIFA World Cup 2022 by highlighting IGA’s role in air traffic and offering exciting events and competitions for football fans. The campaign reached over 5.6 million people and achieved a 6.15% growth on IGA Istanbul Airport’s Instagram account. At the Digiday Europe Awards we earned two more nominations for “Best Influencer Collaboration” projects, and one extra on the “Best Use Of Social” category with “More Than A Final 2023”.</span></p><p><span>In the words of our co-founder, Afşın Avcı, “Awards are important and gratifying, but what’s really important is to successfully exceed our clients´ expectations while continuing to amplify their voice and presence on a global scale. Today, if you want to promote your brand or campaigns in international markets, you must make use of the digital world. In doing so, you must create innovative projects and collaborate with extraordinary names from the digital world and social media. At INFLOW, we execute projects for brands from every sector with the world’s leading influencers and digital thought leaders. We bring to life projects that align with the brand’s essence, carried out by influencers who can uphold the brand’s weight and excitement, all around the world.”</span></p><p><span>At INFLOW Network, we’ve always worked towards making forward-thinking projects that best exalt our client’s good name, interest, and reputation, always creating everything powered by engagement.&nbsp; We can’t deny that being nominated for an award is really flattering, as it demonstrates that the industry is recognizing the work our team does behind the scenes, tailoring and cratfting experiences that exceed borders. But taking home the award is definitely the cherry on top as brings along this satisfactory feeling. We couldn’t be more honored to win this award this year, and we would like to thank everyone who made it possible for us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you’d like to watch our after-movie, please click </span><span><a href=#><span>here</span></a></span>.</p><p><span>For further inquiries, visit our </span><span><a href=#><span>contact page</span></a></span><span><span>.</span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGigp56cpMRuusStrqiqm2KwprjEm6marJWoenN9jKKlrZ2io661tc6nmKVlkayus7DSZqCnm5yqsaq6xmabop%2BZma66ecSuqaiolah6o7HSrWSerpWjwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./linda-hamilton.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Linda Hamilton</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-web-component-for-swapping-text-between-text-html-and-markdown.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Web Component for Swapping Text between Text, HTML, and Markdown Chris Coyier</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
