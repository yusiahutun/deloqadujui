Our showrunner and director of the first three episodes had such an incredible vision from day one - Larry had paintings and images and things to draw from to build this world.</p><p id=eTV-LwSpALkC data-wc=28>It was such a clear picture. It is not sepia toned, there is color and life, but also the danger and romance and adventure that is the West.</p><h2>The first episode plays into the themes we know from Walker, of morality and justice. But how will it also differ?</h2><p id=eOWF4-Au0_kE data-wc=44>Kat: Our show has more danger. plays in 2022 and their world is our modern world.
