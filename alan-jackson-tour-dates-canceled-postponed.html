The affected shows are Friday night's (Oct. 7) show in Atlantic City, N.J., and Saturday night's stop Pittsburgh, Pa. No makeup date has been announced for either show.</p><p>"I hoped I’d be able to be there," Jackson writes at his <a href=#>website</a>. "I hate to disappoint my fans. I tried as much as I could to play this show at this time."</p><p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth is a non-life threatening neurological condition that affects his gross motor skills. When Jackson <a href=#>revealed the diagnosis</a> in 2021, he admitted he'd been living with it for several years and that other family members have, or had it. Part of the reason he shared&nbsp;his diagnosis was that it was becoming more obvious that he was dealing with something, and that it may force him to retire from the road sooner than&nbsp;he wants to.</p><p>One dollar from every ticket sold for this tour was earmarked for CMT Research Foundation. <a href=#>The tour began</a> on June 24 in Mississippi.</p><p>Jackson does have one other notable appearance scheduled for 2022: On Oct. 14 he's set to receive CMT's (Country Music Television) <a href=#>Artist of a Lifetime</a> Award in Nashville. He's just the seventh artist to receive the honor, although it's not clear if he'll attend the event, especially with news of his health setback.&nbsp;<a href=#>Carly Pearce,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Cody Johnson</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kane Brown</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Luke Combs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Walker Hayes</a>&nbsp;are also being honored that night.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Spectacular Hilltop Estate</h2><p>After selling their spectacular Southern manor home in 2010, Alan Jackson and his wife moved to to what might be an even more impressive mansion, if that's even possible. Their 5-bedroom, 8-bathroom, 22,012-square-foot estate in the same Nashville suburb of Franklin features bedrooms that are all well-appointed suites, while the formal dining and living areas are finished off with splendid arched doorways, oversized windows and elaborate woodwork. The residence also includes a bar, a media room and multiple indoor and outdoor fireplaces. It sold for $19 million in March of 2021.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Alan Jackson Pictures, Through the Years</h2><p>Alan Jackson has always been a handsome man and we have the pictures to prove it.
