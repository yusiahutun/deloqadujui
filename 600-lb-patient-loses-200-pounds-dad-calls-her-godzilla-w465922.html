Now looking at another weight-loss surgery as an adult, and with two grown siblings with busy lives of their own, Erica found herself having trouble summoning personal willpower without a strong support network.</p><p>To her credit, Erica’s sister Molly joined Erica on the trip to Texas from California several times to see her stomach surgeon, Dr. Nowzaradan, but her brother, Robert, didn’t, despite her pleas. Thus, Erica was prone to losing focus and pushing responsibility onto someone else.</p><p>Still, Nowzaradan said, Erica needed to take responsibility for her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>: “Erica is making progress, but her attitude can still be very poor. That just means I need more evidence that she’s not going to fall back into bad habits.” Near the end of the process, she lamented that “there’s really not much for me to eat,” and she’s “hungry all the time.”</p><p>Here were five memorable moments from watching Erica go from 661 pounds to 471 — a total weight loss of 190 pounds.</p><p><b>1. The sisterly bond of Molly and Erica</b></p><p>Even though the two went back and forth with snipes, Molly, in the end, was there for her sister, joining her on trips to Texas, and waiting in the doctor’s waiting room as Erica’s stomach staples were removed. Molly wasn’t always nice about it — and neither was Erica — but Molly gave of herself when no one else would. “I’m sorry I’m a pain in the ass,” Erica told her sister in a bonding moment toward the end of treatment. “I will do what I need to do, Molly — promise.”</p><p><b>2. The backstory of Erica’s antagonizing dad — who, she said, teased her about her weight mercilessly when she was growing up</b></p><p>As Erica gained pounds as a teenager, he asked her what had happened to his beautiful little girl. “She went to sleep one night and woke up Godzilla,” Erica recalled tearfully of what her dad said. “I just wanted my dad to love and tell me he wasn’t disappointed I was his daughter.” Dad’s absence on the show is conspicuous, given that he still seemed to be in this picture — Erica mentioned that her dad didn’t know her history “to this day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/6002-47dca51e-b3f7-4a81-9c95-29e0c0bfff37.jpg><p><b>3. The “stomach stapling” procedure was obsolete, Dr. Nowzaradan said during the show, and potentially a mess for Erica, who underwent it 27 years prior, at age 17.</b></p><p>The stapling surgery did little to help Erica’s long-term weight loss. But it did give her both scar tissue and rogue staples, the latter of which Nowzaradan removed before giving Erica the 2017-standard gastric-bypass surgery. “Erica has shown me that she’s willing to try,” the medical professional said. “So I’m willing to do all I can to give her the tool to keep her on track for the long term.”</p><p><b>4. Erica’s bittersweet missing of her mom, who died several years previously in a car accident</b></p><p>It was Mom, Erica said, not Dad, who knew of Erica’s devastating teenage secret — that she was gang raped at age 16, which was also her first intercourse experience. Erica said her mom truly understood Erica’s pain and would have done anything for her — including helping to facilitate her teenage stomach stapling surgery. “She never gave up on me,” Erica said in an interview.</p><p><b>5. The battle of the nutritionist vs. food-delivery service</b></p><p>While Erica was still living in California — not fully committed to losing weight and with a more hands-off family — she was struggling to find the discipline and stamina to lose weight. At the mandate of Dr. Nowzaradan, a nutritionist named Susan Swadener visited Erica’s house and essentially raided the abode of junk food as a distressed Erica watched on. “I can’t believe she just wasted all that food,” Erica said in an interview after the nutritionist left. “But I can just order more, and there’s nothing she can really do to stop me from doing that. So she completely wasted her time.”</p><p>Tell <i>Us: </i>What did you think of Erica’s journey?</p><p><i><a href=#>My 600-lb Life</a> </i>airs on TLC Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaG1paF2hr268wK2gnqakYrmwv8SsZGtoYGK9sMHNnapmnJGZeqSty6WqZqCVp3qou8OzoKWkkWLEdYKUcmlrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chelsea-handler.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chelsea Handler Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-best-jordan-peele-movies-and-tv-shows-to-watch-amid-the-release-of-monkey-man-1293540.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Best Jordan Peele Movies And TV Shows To Watch Amid The Release Of Monkey Man</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
