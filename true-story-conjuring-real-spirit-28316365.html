a family of seven who moved into a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island in 1971.</p><p>They lived at the 14-room property between 1971 to 1980, during which time they reported terrifying paranormal activity - from bed lifting, to hearing voices and being attacked by spirits.</p><p>The home was subsequently visited by two of America's most renowned paranormal investigators, The Warrens, who tried to make contact with the spirits who lived there.</p><p>Known as one of America's most famous hauntings, the events experienced by both The Perrons and The Warrens later inspired The Conjuring.</p><h3>Who were The Warrens?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28226701.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN-haunted.jpg><p>Ed and Lorraine Warren are one of the most famous ghost hunting couples in American history, and together, they investigated some of the country's reportedly haunted properties including The Amityville House.</p><p>In 1952, they also founded the New England Society for Psychic Research.</p><p>That's not all, as Lorraine also claimed to be a clairvoyant and a medium, with the ability to communicate with the spirits she and her husband came into contact with during their investigations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>They came face to face with some of the most terrifying haunted objects in the world too, including the famous Anabelle doll, which has since become the subject of its own films and encounters with The Warrens.</p><p>It is one such encounter that led The Warrens to house Anabelle in their Occult Museum in Connecticut, which is home to a number of reportedly haunted objects to this day.</p><p>The Warrens are no longer with us however, with Ed dying in 2006 and Lorraine passing away 13 years later in 2019.</p><h3>What happened at the Perron family home?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321669.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_American-ghost-hunters-Lorraine-and-Ed-Warren.jpg><p>After moving into the farmhouse on Rhode Island, The Perron family claimed that they came face to face with paranormal activity in the home.</p><p>This included being woken up at 5:15am most mornings, when the spirits would reportedly lift the beds and fill the rooms with the smell of rotting flesh.</p><p>The basement was also said to be a hotspot for spiritual activity.</p><p>One particularly terrifying spirit would also consistently torment mother Carolyn Perron, and speaking to USA Today, eldest daughter Andrea said: "Whoever the spirit was, she perceived herself to be mistress of the house and she resented the competition my mother posed for that position."</p><h3>What events in The Conjuring actually took place?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321671.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_The-Conjuring-fim-2013.jpg><p>Lorraine Warren was later a major consultant on The Conjuring film, and told USA Today that almost everything that happened in the film was accurate.</p><p>She said: "The things that went on there were just so incredibly frightening.</p><p>"It still affects me to talk about it today."</p><p>In the film, the spirit who is thought to have tormented Carolyn was Bathsheba, who is a focal point throughout The Conjuring.</p><p>However, speaking on an episode of paranormal investigation series Ghost Brothers: Lights Out, Andrea Perron said Bathsheba was not responsible.</p><p>She said: "Bathsheba was not the culprit in this house. The spirit that was haunting and taunting my mother, in this house, was long dead before Bathsheba was ever born."</p><p>Andrea added that her father thought it was a woman who had lived at the property previously called Mrs Arnold, who had considered herself "the mistress of the house," but later died in the barnyard of the house, not long after the death of her husband.</p><p>Following the paranormal activity, the film shows The Perrons reaching out to The Warrens, who did indeed make multiple visits during 1974, as shown in The Conjuring Film.</p><p>They also claimed that during one of their visits, the spirit of Bathsheba showed itself to them in the living room of the property, and said its name - as shown in the film.</p><p>However, despite an exorcism being performed in The Conjuring, this part of the film did not happen in real life.</p><p>Instead, The Warrens attempted to summon a spirit through a séance, with Andrea saying that her mum became to speak in a different language and "voice not her own," before being levitated and thrown across a room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321676.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Globe-Reporter-Stays-At-House-That-Inspired-The-Conjuring.jpg><p>Speaking to paranormal investigation team Ghost Brothers as part of their Discovery+ series Ghost Brothers: Lights Out, which saw Andrea Perron return to her old family home, she said: "My mother never called The Warrens. She had no idea who they were when they showed up at our door."</p><p>She added: "The Warrens turned up and told my parents they wanted to identify who the offending spirit was. They wanted to conduct a séance in the house and they brought with them a priest and a medium."</p><p>Speaking about the seance, she continued: "What happened that night was a long, drawn out affair, but it culminated in a séance that lasted no more than five minutes."</p><p>"My mum opened her eyes and they didn't look like her eyes anymore," said Andrea of her mother, adding: "I don't think my mother was possessed, she was attacked."</p><h3>Is the house still haunted?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321681.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_The-Conjuring-2013.jpg><p>Many paranormal teams have investigated the property in the years since the Perron family haunting took place, including Ghost Adventures and more recently, Ghost Brothers.</p><p>The Ghost Brothers team recently visited the property for their programme Ghost Brothers: Lights Out, which is currently airing on Discovery+, in an episode called The Perron Family Nightmare.</p><p>During their time on the property, the team encountered an abundance of activity that can be witnessed in the programme, including doors opening on their own, electronic voice phenomenon and feelings of being grabbed or touched.</p><p>Speaking about the investigation, team member Dalen said: "As crazy as The Conjuring was, it didn't even come close to what we experienced tonight."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321683.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_The-Conjuring-2-2016.jpg><p>They also spoke to the family who currently live in the property, who also revealed their own experiences of activity in the house, including seeing shadow people.</p><p>"We think it's the property itself that is haunted. We don't believe it's the actual house. We think it's where the house is located," they said.</p><p>Talking about their plans for the property, they continued: "As of right now, we're in the process of selling it."</p><p>"I personally didn't expect how much of a toll it would take on us emotionally," adding: "I don't think it was meant for someone to live in full time."</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>here.</a></i></b></p><p><b>READ MORE:</b></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Little Shop of Horrors cast now - punched in head, death at 43 and Hollywood divorce</a></li><li><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein stars now – tragic deaths, co-star romance and Harry Potter</a></li><li><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Dracula stars now - Harry Potter fame, criminal conviction and tragic deaths</a></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27167084><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="'Cursed' Hollywood films - eerie coincidences, tragic deaths and make-up poisoning" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27167084><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321685.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Globe-Reporter-Stays-At-House-That-Inspired-The-Conjuring.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27169673.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_BANNER.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27167084>'Cursed' Hollywood films - eerie coincidences, tragic deaths and make-up poisoning</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28230561><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Inside chilling real life graveyard where soap bosses 'bury' Emmerdale icons" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28230561><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28321689.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_The-true-story-of-The-Conjuring-Feud-with-The-Warrens-house-has-been-sold-multiple-times-daughte.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28231474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_BANNER-tricia.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28230561>Inside chilling real life graveyard where soap bosses 'bury' Emmerdale icons</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdloq6utlWLAtbvRsmScp56fwrO1zaBkq52RoXq0vMiroK1lYm2AcoKSb2w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelli-seymour.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kelli Seymour dating?
