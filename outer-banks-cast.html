The show’s creators, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Pate</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonas Pate</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannon Burke</a>, infused Outer Banks with a perfect blend of mystery, suspense and coming-of-age drama, drawing inspiration from classic adventure tales like The Goonies.</p><p>The story revolves around a group of friends embarking on a dangerous quest for treasure while navigating the complexities of adolescence and social hierarchy. With its picturesque setting, compelling characters, and pulse-pounding plot twists, Outer Banks quickly garnered a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim, solidifying its place as a must-watch series on Netflix.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Here we look at the Outer Banks cast.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chase Stokes as John B Routledge in the Outer Banks cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/1_749001.jpg><p>Born in 1992, in Annapolis, Maryland, the charismatic and handsome <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chase Stokes</a> plays the role of John B Routledge in the Outer Banks cast.

He also appeared in a few movies including the role of young Dale in Between Waves (2018) and Martin in Dr. Bird’s Advice for Sad Poets (2021).</p><p>His big break came when he landed the role in the Outer Banks cast. Stokes plays the leader of the Pogues crew, John B and told People he’s drawn to his character, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because regardless of the obstacles that he faces, he’s willing to take them head-on</a>.”</p><p>Ironically, he told Jimmy Kimmel Live&nbsp;that he initially passed on the role when he first read it.&nbsp; Stokes said, “I was like, ‘That’s&nbsp;The Goonies. That’s for sure&nbsp;The Goonies. I don’t want to destroy that.’ So I passed on it. And I was like, ‘Nope. Not doing that.'”</p><p>Lucky for us, he reconsidered.</p><p>Stokes dated fellow Outer Banks costar&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madelyn Cline</a> for more than a year, but they broke up in 2021.

I try to center myself by doing activities that bring me back down to earth, but the main thing I feel is gratitude.”</p><p>She’s very close to her family, who is very proud of her. She told Cosmopolitan, “My dad was like, ‘I just can’t believe at 25, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you’ve traveled to more places</a> than every single person in your family combined.’</p><p>Cline has 6.8 million followers on TikTok and recently announced on Instagram that she’s a Revlon spokesperson.
