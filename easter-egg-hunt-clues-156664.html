All that’s left to do is plan the perfect Easter egg hunt with clues that both adults and kids will love. No pressure, right? Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p><ul><li>Decide how many eggs you want to hide. This will be determined by the number of kids, space available, and how much time you have.</li><li>Create clues on your own or rely on the magic of Pinterest for thousands of ideas on Easter egg hunt clues.&nbsp;</li><li>Print out or write out the clues and cut them into small strips. Fill each egg with a clue.</li><li>If the goal is to just find eggs, you don’t need to worry about putting the eggs and clues in a particular order. But if the goal is to get to a big prize at the end of the hunt, then you will need to make sure the clues follow each other in order.</li><li>It’s also a fun idea to use a few golden eggs among all the lawn-strewn eggs to hide clues for Easter baskets.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you have kids who have food allergies or you don’t want to use candy, follow <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Zaida Khaze</a>‘s example. The mother of two kids (one with severe food allergies) has to use her creativity when planning an Easter egg hunt with clues. She fills eggs with riddles and hides them in one room.&nbsp;</p><p>Each egg has a clue to a gift in another room. The gifts can range from flavored chapstick, toys that come in packs of 6, 8 or 19 (<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopkins</a>, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Num Noms</a>, and this year <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">L.O.L</a>s), and other thematic trinkets from Target’s dollar section.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the game fair between siblings, she has equivalent prizes color coded and she tells her girls to only grab one or two of each color.

If you’ve ever seen the way adults act at an organized Easter egg hunt, then you understand just how much they look forward to diving for eggs. So, if your holiday gathering includes grown-ups, it might be fun to come up with some more challenging clues.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few ideas for Easter egg hunt clues for adults:</p><ul><li>Create clues and riddles based on movies or television shows.</li><li>Create clues based on outdoor parties (barbecue, sports-themed, etc.).</li><li>Create clues based on pop culture or sports trivia.</li><li>Create clues based on family lore, inside jokes, and old stories.</li><li>Expand the search to cover a larger terrain (all three stories of your house; the entire neighborhood).</li><li>Fill eggs with money, gift cards, or lottery tickets to bring out people’s competitive sides.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ideas for Easter Egg Hunt Clues</h2><p>You can never run out of ideas for Easter egg hunt clues. But if you’re crunched for time and looking for a few quick and easy Easter egg hunt clues, here are some great ideas for younger kids. You can write these clues on paper or print them out and put them in plastic eggs all around your house:</p><ul><li>Go look in one of mom’s shoes.</li><li>This egg is hiding where you use a towel.</li><li>Look under a chair.</li><li>This egg is hiding in the messiest room in the house.</li><li>Look under the bed that is never made.</li><li>Go look in your favorite hot cocoa mug.</li><li>This one is hanging with one of your coats (put an egg in a coat pocket).</li><li>This is where the dirty clothes go.</li></ul><p>Here are a few Easter egg hunt clues that rhyme or have a fill-in-the-blank for a riddle.</p><ul><li>The first egg is clean. Try looking in a machine.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t go down the garden path, because this one is hiding upstairs in the &nbsp;_____________ &nbsp;(bath).&nbsp;</li><li>If you’re feeling able, go look under the &nbsp;_____________ &nbsp;(table).&nbsp;</li><li>Do you get cold when walking across a bridge? This egg sure gets cold, because it is hiding in the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(fridge).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Jennifer Porter, a children’s <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">apparel and gift retailer</a> and experienced party planner, says she likes to use a kids nursery rhyme or bunny-themed storybook prose for the rolled up clues. Put the Easter egg clues in plastic eggs and put them in order to reveal the clue for the big Easter basket. The final clue should guide hunters to a new location to hunt for the basket.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Printable Easter Egg Hunt Clues</h2><p>You don’t want to rely on Post-it notes for all of your Easter egg hunt clues. So, why not put the clues on individual eggs that you can print and cut out?</p><ul><li>Start with an image of an egg. Pinterest is full of printable pages including this one from <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Baby Hints & Tips</a></li><li>Use different colors such as pink, purple, yellow, and green to color in the egg.</li><li>Type the clues on each egg using different colored text.&nbsp;</li><li>Use white card stock to print and cut out the eggs.</li><li>Put each Easter egg hunt clue in a plastic egg and hide inside and outside. The kids will then hunt for the eggs, starting with the first clue.&nbsp;</li><li>You can also use double-sided sticky tape to put the Easer egg hunt clues for outside all around your yard (on fence posts, side of your house, tree, etc.). Or tape the eggs with Easter egg hunt clues for indoors on items like the couch, chair, table, TV, refrigerator, window, etc). The kids can hunt for the paper egg clues and check them off on a master list as they move from one clue to the next.&nbsp;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/best-easter-egg-hunt-clues.jpg><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Easter Egg Hunt Clues for Outside</h2><p>If you have a yard with enough space for an Easter egg scavenger hunt and an Easter egg hunt with clues, you can plan two different activities for the kids.</p><p>For the Easter egg scavenger hunt with clues, start by coloring and decorating hard-boiled eggs. Next, make a scavenger hunt sheet with images of the eggs and the number of eggs your kids need to find. Hide the eggs around the yard. Finally, give your kids the Easter egg scavenger hunt clue handout and let them go. Alternatively, you can use common Easter basket items to make an Easter egg scavenger hunt with clues. Hide Easter grass, a bunny stuffed animal, colored hard-boiled eggs, jelly beans, a chocolate bunny, etc. The clues can be one to two words with or without a picture on a card stock clue sheet. &nbsp;</p><p>The Easter egg hunt with clues will involve more eggs (plastic type) and more time. Start by creating, printing and Easter egg hunt clues that are appropriate for outside. Next, cut out the clues and put one in each plastic egg. Hide the eggs outside based on the clues in each egg. Finally, send your kids outdoors to look for the eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of Easter egg hunt clues for outside can range from simple pictures or a few words to complex rhymes and riddles. Simple Easter egg hunt clues include:</p><ul><li>This egg is near the tallest tree in the yard</li><li>This one is hiding where the cat sleeps</li><li>Go to the front door. Now take 20 steps and turn right. Look up and you will see the golden egg hiding in a tree.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>It’s easy to make Easter egg hunt clues that rhyme or can be turned into a riddle. Here are a few to get you started.</p><ul><li>It’s short and green and rhymes with glass, why not try looking near the &nbsp;_____________ &nbsp;(grass).</li><li>Better move your feet, because this egg is hiding in the car &nbsp;_____________ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(seat).</li><li>Find your power and look near the red &nbsp;_____________ &nbsp;(flower).</li><li>Get moving like a fox, because this egg is hiding in the mail &nbsp;_____________ &nbsp;(box).</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Easter Egg Hunt Clues for Toddlers</h2><p>Toddlers love Easter egg hunts. But if their reading skills are not high enough to understand the longer clues, you can modify them by using single words and pictures. If your Easter egg hunt is outside, you can fill the plastic eggs with Easter egg hunt clues for toddlers, such as:</p><ul><li>Picture of an outdoor toy (wagon, bike, etc)</li><li>Picture of the fence</li><li>Picture of outdoor furniture</li><li>Picture of a flower in one of your gardens</li><li>Picture of a birdhouse</li><li>Picture of a rain boot</li></ul><p>You can add a description to each picture for kids who are learning to read. If you’re doing an Easter egg hunt for toddlers that ends with their Easter basket, you can use visual clues with numbers to arrange into order and guide them to their Easter baskets.&nbsp;</p><p>Another favorite Easter egg hunt for toddlers is the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Egg Scavenger Hunt to Make Words</a>. Start with writing a few words related to Easter on a piece of card stock or construction paper. The words should be big enough for a matching activity. Write the words again on another piece of paper and cut out the letters (you can also use foam letters). Hide one letter in each egg. After your kids have collected all of the eggs, they can match the letters fro the eggs to the letters on the card stock. You can have them glue the letters with a glue stick. Once the word identified, they get a prize.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More From FIRST</h2><p><a href=#>How to Get Easter Egg Dye Off Your Hands Without Harsh Chemicals</a></p><p><a href=#>How to Make the Perfect Boiled Egg Every Single Time</a></p><p><a href=#>The Egg Rack Is the Worst Place in Your Refrigerator to Store Eggs</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BarrTAxKtknp%2BXYrW2utNmmqWtlah6coGVb21t</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./horatio-sanz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Horatio Sanz Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-actor-joey-graceffa-is-in-relationship-with-daniel-preda-are-they-engaged-know-in-detail-about-their-affairs-and-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>YouTuber's Joey Graceffa Happy in Relationship With Partner Daniel Preda, Will They Get Engaged Soon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
