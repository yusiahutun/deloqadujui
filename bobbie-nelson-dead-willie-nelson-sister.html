She was 91.</p><p>"Her elegance, grace, beauty and talent made this world a better place," a statement about Bobbie from her family reads. "She was the first member of Willie’s band, as his pianist and singer. Our hearts are broken and she will be deeply missed. But we are so lucky to have had her in our lives. Please keep her family in your thoughts and give them the privacy they need at this time."</p><p>Bobbie Nelson was raised alongside Willie by their grandparents in Abbott, Texas. She learned to play the piano at a young age, and eventually formed a band with Willie and&nbsp;her husband, Bud Fletcher. The trio performed at honky-tonks across Texas until Fletcher was killed in a car accident. Soon after, Bobbie took up secretarial work and performed various pianist gigs to supplement her income while raising their three children.</p><p>That all changed when Willie signed a record deal in 1972. Bobbie soon joined his band and quickly became a charismatic staple of his live performances. She also was featured as a vocalist and musician on many of Willie's most iconic albums, including&nbsp;Red Headed Stranger, Phases &&nbsp;Stages&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stardust.</p><p>Bobbie Nelson released her debut solo album&nbsp;Audiobiography in 2007, which included two songs featuring guitar and vocal accompaniment from&nbsp;her brother. In 2017, she was inducted into the&nbsp;Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Willie Nelson was known to lovingly refer to Bobbie as "little sister" during their live performances.&nbsp;The&nbsp;siblings&nbsp;kept a close relationship even in recent years, penning a memoir together entitled&nbsp;Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of The Family Band in 2020.</p><p>The 2021 album&nbsp;The Willie Nelson Family was a collaborative project from Willie, Bobbie,&nbsp;Willie's&nbsp;sons Lukas and Micah, as well as his daughters Paula and Amy. The project, which would become one of Bobbie's final releases, included a mixture of inspirational classics and new versions of classic Willie Nelson tracks.</p><p>Bobbie Nelson was expected to perform&nbsp;alongside her family members at Luck Reunion, a music festival held at Willie Nelson's ranch in Luck, Texas, on March 17.</p><p><strong>See Pictures of Willie Nelson Through the Years</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6eSl7amec2eo6ynnmKxpq3DZq6ipJyesm66xKWqqKZdqLa0wMSrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-wear-ankle-boots-pants.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Wear Ankle Boots: 5 New Ideas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-flowers-group-marks-1-year-anniversary-with-artist-development-new-executive-staff-partnerships-with-ghostly-growth-drink-sum-wtr-labels.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All Flowers Group Marks 1 Year Anniversary With Artist Development, New Executive Staff &amp;amp; Partnershi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
