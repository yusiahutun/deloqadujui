With unbounding energy and a big bark, an&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Aries dog is definitely unmissable</a>; they make it so! Because Aries can be a bit moody, this dog may seem snuggly and cuddly one minute and then distant the next. They may play by their own rules, so good training is a must.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: </strong>moody, excited, naive, fun-loving, athletic</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1307728913.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: APRIL 20 – MAY 20</strong></h4><p>Taurus&nbsp;is the slow-moving, chill-until-you-push-me-too-far sign of the zodiac. So, any Taurus dog is likely one that enjoys relaxing, eating, and basking in warm or fuzzy places. In all honesty, this dog could probably sleep all day. And if you try to move them, they can become <a href=# rel=noopener>stubborn and snippy</a>. But if you have a Taurus dog, you’ll likely have a buddy for life.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: l</strong>oyal, dependable, slow, lazy, loving</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-998740302.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: MAY 21 – JUNE 20</strong></h4><p>Gemini&nbsp;is sometimes referred to as the sign that has too many thoughts flying through their head at once. If you think about this in dog form, a Gemini dog will probably be one of the most <a href=# rel=noopener>highly-functioning dogs</a> with the smallest attention span. This animal is very smart and loves to learn, but keeping them focused is a challenge. Small training sessions and a lot of exercise is the way to go.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: excited, friendly, sociable, unfocused, intelligent</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1253605455.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: JUNE 21 – JULY 22</strong></h4><p>Cancer&nbsp;dogs are some of the sweetest, <a href=# rel=noopener>most cuddly animals</a> out there. They love to be at home with you, but really, wherever you are is where “home” is. Cancer dogs are very sensitive. They will take things to heart if you are too harsh on them so training with this in mind is crucial.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: s</strong>weet, sensitive, loyal, loving</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-675609349.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: JULY 23 – AUGUST 22</strong></h4><p>In the zodiac, Leo is the sign that pulls attention. They draw the spotlight on them—sometimes willingly, but most of the time they do this without realizing it. So, a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leo</a>&nbsp;dog will probably be quite loud, excitable, and have big,&nbsp;extreme&nbsp;movements. <a href=# rel=noopener>Being a Leo</a> means loving your family and being very protective. So, this dog might need to experience many people coming into their lives so they don’t become aggressively protective.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: f</strong>aithful, loud, active, proud</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1355035543-1.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: AUGUST 23 – SEPTEMBER 22</strong></h4><p>Virgo&nbsp;is extremely willing-to-please. Likewise, a Virgo dog is also willing-to-please. This animal can be trained like a military dog due to its extreme <a href=# rel=noopener>attention to detail</a> and proficiency for listening. All in all, a Virgo dog will be not only ride-or-die, but very dependable in times of chaos when well-trained.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: d</strong>ependable, caring, willing-to-please, thoughtful</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-592237583.jpg><h4 data-skm-boomerang-el-1=processed><strong>DATE: SEPTEMBER 23 – OCTOBER 22</strong></h4><p>Since Libra represents <a href=# rel=noopener>balance and equality</a>, this kind of dog is likely to think of others before themselves. For example, let’s say this is a big dog who is playing tug-of-war with a small dog. The&nbsp;Libra&nbsp;dog would likely lay down on the ground to “be on their level.” Thoughtful, careful, and very social, a Libra dog is always a win.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: c</strong>onsiderate, polite, diligent, friendly, happy</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1241525012.jpg><h4 data-skm-boomerang-el-1=processed><strong>DATE: OCTOBER 23 – NOVEMBER 21</strong></h4><p>A&nbsp;Scorpio&nbsp;dog will seem shy at first. In fact, they may even <a href=# rel=noopener>appear to be aggressive</a> at first—such as barking when people get close. But that’s just a defense mechanism. This dog is the ultimate ride-or-die partner. Once they trust you, they will go to the ends of the Earth for you without question.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: l</strong>oyal, distant, suspicious, shy, quiet</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1446107881.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: NOVEMBER 22 – DECEMBER 21</strong></h4><p>Since&nbsp;Sagittarius&nbsp;is the expander of the zodiac, this kind of dog is probably one most prone to running away or at least… “wandering.” Sagittarius is an adventurer, an explorer, and <a href=# rel=noopener>an optimist</a>. A Sagittarius dog possesses all of these characteristics. Find them exploring new lands or homes without fear. Experience their happy energy no matter what the situation.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: h</strong>appy-go-lucky, positive, fun-loving, friendly, intelligent</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1250983518.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: APRIL 20 – MAY 20</strong></h4><p>Capricorn&nbsp;takes everything—including themselves—very seriously. So, you can imagine that this kind of dog would live and die for the routine they’ve claimed responsibility over. For example, a <a href=# rel=noopener>Capricorn dog</a> would be the one to grab the newspaper every morning until the day they died.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: d</strong>utiful, serious, easy to train</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-496236528.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: JANUARY 20 – FEBRUARY 18</strong></h4><p>Being an Aquarian dog means you sometimes come up with your own rules. So, in that respect, they are definitely not the easiest dogs to train. But the trick with an&nbsp;Aquarius&nbsp;dog is that you have to let them <a href=# rel=noopener>do their own thing</a>. Trust that they are keeping your training in mind, and that they require the freedom and trust from their owner to come back.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: i</strong>ndividualist, stubborn, smart, unique</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1321139698.jpg><h4><strong>DATE: FEBRUARY 19 – MARCH 20</strong></h4><p>Pisces&nbsp;is a soft and sensitive sign. Say something the wrong way to them, and they will hide away in their shell. For a Pisces dog, this information is very important to know. They need an owner who will be able to feel what they feel. Additionally, a Pisces dog will be very <a href=# rel=noopener>sensitive to emotions</a>. If you’re stressed, sad, or angry, this dog knows.</p><h4><strong>TRAITS: e</strong>mpathetic, sensitive, loving, humble</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=1024 height=482 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdISWcG9vZ6qksaqtwmaqop%2BeqHqlu8Zmp56qo6S7orjIrbBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-astonishing-facts-about-architect.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Astonishing Facts About Architect</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ralph-tresvant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ralph Tresvant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
