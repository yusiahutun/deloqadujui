The continent is massive, with numerous diverse religious traditions. Africa has three main religions: Christianity, Islam, and traditional. However, despite the prevalence of Christianity and Islam, Africans still abide by their traditional practices and hold numerous beliefs. In Yorubaland, a region in Africa spanning <a href=#>Nigeria</a>, Benin and Togo, there is the Orishas. The Orishas are a group of spirits or deities that act as the emissaries of Olodumare or God almighty. So, what roles do they play and why are they important? A list of Orishas and their powers is sufficient to provide a good reply.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f2aef95c42be9e14.jpeg><p class=align-left>Although many Africans have shunned traditional ways, many still abide by their pre-Christian ancestral practices. Hence the adherence to conventional religion. And it is believed that there is a supernatural presence on earth. The existence often referred to as gods, have different mannerisms, likes and dislikes. And among the Yoruba people, they are referred to as Orisha. So, how many African Orishas are there?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da22acca93ce90c2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of Most Entertaining Kenyan Politicians in 2022 Whose Sense of Humour Leave Netizens in Stitches</span></p></a><h2>List of Orishas and their powers</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Orishas originated</a> from their primary creator, God (Olodumare in Yoruba). They act as demi-deities or demi-gods or in a <a href=#>capacity like Archangels</a>. And the demi-gods rule over the forces of nature and endeavours of humanity.</p><p class=align-left>Even though there are several Orishas, some are more potent than others. These powerful Orishas create the seven African powers, including Eshu Elegbara, Ogun, Obatala, Yemaya, Oshun, Shango, and Oya. The seventh is often substituted with Orunmila or Ochossi. So, who is the strongest Orisha?</p><h3>1. Eshu Elegbara</h3><p class=align-left>Eshu (also referred to as Elegua, Exu, Eshu and Legba) is the messenger between worlds and is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">guardian of the crossroads</a>. According to traditional beliefs, nearly all spirits linked to the crossroads are tricksters, and Elegbara is no exception.</p><p class=align-left>Eshu operates as a psychopomp (someone who guides the spirits of the dead) and protector of travellers, living or dead. Therefore, among the 7 African powers, Eshu’s is one of the most significant, considering its relevance and reliance by virtually everyone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4b28e08917a8e39.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Popular South African names for boys</span></p></a><p class=align-left>All prayers must pass through him before reaching any other Orisha. Therefore, he acts as the intermediary link between the other Orishas and humans. The deity's favourite offerings are tobacco, rum, candy, toys, and spicy foods.</p><p class=align-left>Eshu has over 200 manifestations depending on tradition. He is most associated with the colours red and black or white.</p><h3>2. Ogun</h3><p class=align-left>Ogun is the god of iron; hence, he rules over metalworking and alchemy. The deity is also the owner of technology. While Eshu Elegbara opens the road, Ogun clears it with his machete.</p><p class=align-left>The deity is associated with the colours green, red, white, black, and blue. Ogun's favourite offerings include cigars, rum, wine, red palm oil, candles, metal, metal tools, chains, weapons, red <a href=#>beans</a>, and spicy foods.</p><h3>3. Obatala</h3><p class=align-left>Obatala is the eldest of the Orishas. The deity's most outstanding characteristics include patience and gentleness. Obatala rules over legal matters, serenity and peace. The demi-god is also a <a href=#>remarkable spirit</a> of healing and peace. Obatala is also credited with sculpturing human bodies, more so with imperfections like blindness and other defects.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ea12d58510cc3403.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of African musical instruments and their names</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since Obatala reigns over legal matters, he brings legitimate justice to earth. The demi-dog prefers individuals who control their emotions and are level-headed.</p><p class=align-left>Obatala's favourite offerings include cascarilla powder, sugar, shea butter, water, milk, white rice, banana, and white flowers. Obatala is the only deity with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">no permanent gender</a>, and the demi-god is androgynous. Obatala is married to Yemaya, the goddess of oceans and godmother of Orishas.</p><h3>4. Yemaya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da22acca93ce90c2.jpg><p class=align-left>Yemaya is a water Orisha presiding over the oceans. The demi-god is often depicted as a mermaid and has domain over everything related to the sea. On top of the ocean, Yemaya rules over maternity in people's lives as she is the Mother of All. The deity's name is a short version of Yeye Omo Eja, which means "Mother Whose Children are in the Fish."</p><p class=align-left>Yemaya is the sister of Oshun, the deity of rivers. The god dresses in seven skirts of blue and white, and like the seas and deep lakes, she is deep and unknowable. Her favourite offerings include seashells, jewellery, perfume, coral, flowers, <a href=#>watermelon</a>, pomegranate, duck, lamb, fish, plantain chips, coconut cake, and molasses.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b707e035f0c5437.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 greatest African warriors who changed the continent's history</span></p></a><h3>5. Oshun</h3><p class=align-left>What are the powers of Oshun? She is the Orisha of rivers, and baptism over water invokes her purifying essence. The deity is the most approached to assist in money matters. Also, she is the youngest among the female Orishas but retains the title of Iyolode or great queen. It is important to note that Oya and Oshun don’t get along. On the other hand, people believe that Oshun and Yemaya are sisters and venerate them together.</p><p class=align-left>What Orisha colours does Oshin take? Oshun recognizes herself in yellow and gold; her number is five. The deity's favourite offerings include mirrors, rosemary, lantana, marigold, pumpkin, makeup, brushes, perfumes, oils, flowers, fans, sandalwood, honey, chamomile tea, shrimp and spinach, yellow and orange fruits and veggies, cinnamon, river stones, amber, coral.</p><h3>6. Shango</h3><p class=align-left>Shango is the most popular of the seven African powers, and the deity rules over lightning, thunder, fire, drums, and dance. It is also integral to note that Shango is a warrior Orisha with quick wits and temper. He is also married to Obba but has relations with Oya and Oshun.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7f4fbe3054d794e7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ African gods names and meanings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You want Ogun and Shango to interact as they are rivals. Shango will bring justice through lightning and protect his followers against evil. Another vital thing to note is that the deity loves <a href=#>good music</a> and women. Shango’s favourite offerings include copper, mugwort, conqueror root, lots of spicy food, red foods and red palm oil, liquor like red wine and rum, sugar, and cascarilla.</p><h3>7. Oya</h3><p class=align-left>Oya is the ruler of the whirlwind and the gates of the cemetery. The deity is sometimes substituted with Ochossi or Orunmila. Oya's number is nine, and her domain is in the Niger River. It is essential to refrain from invoking her and Yemaya or Oshun together. The only exception is when you are invoking the seven African powers together.</p><p class=align-left>Oya’s favourite offerings include flowers, starfruit, plums, purple grapes, nine eggplants as a traditional offering, bean fritters, red wine, set up an altar at home or set offerings at cemetery gates. Oya is a strong warrior who rides to battle with Shango (sharing lightning and fire with him). The deity was once the wife of Ogun.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ac3dca5f5750f00.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Muigai wa Njoroge wives photos and relationship story</span></p></a><h2>Who is the main Orisha god?</h2><p class=align-left>Oludumare is the one God and creator. Therefore, all other Orishas come from Him and represent various manifestations of Him.</p><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yoruba cosmetology</a>, Obatala is the creator of the human being race. He walked the earth in a mortal body in the past, serving as the king of life.</p><h2>What does it mean when an Orisha chooses you?</h2><p class=align-left>When an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Orisha selects you</a>, you are called to your human purpose on earth, and you need to receive divine assistance and guidance from the Orishas. It can be confusing; therefore, it is integral that you trust your gut and intuition to guide you on this unfamiliar path.</p><h2>Do Orishas have specific days of the week they rule?</h2><p class=align-left>Different Orishas have different days of the week they dominate. Certain days have a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">particular mood to them</a>, and this affects how people reach out. However, different cultures have different schedules for Orishas. Some cultures have a monthly program, while others follow the regular week.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6fbe81a5fcaf38f8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ifa religion history, rules, initiation, sacrifices, voodoo, and facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is integral to check out the list of Orishas and their powers to know who you should call upon when in need.
