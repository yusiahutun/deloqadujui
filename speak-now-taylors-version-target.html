Since Speak Now was all about my songwriting, I decided to go to the artists who I feel influenced me most powerfully as a lyricist at that time and ask them to sing on the album. They’re so cool and generous for agreeing to support my version of Speak Now. I recorded this album when I was 32 (and still growing up, now) and can’t wait to unveil it all to you on July 7th.”</p><p>Hayley Williams expressed her excitement about being on her closest friend’s album on Instagram: “Taylor was the first industry friend I ever made and hung out with outside of work things. When Speak Now dropped, I bought my friend’s record (as you do!) and listened to the whole thing in my first car, sitting still in the driveway. It’s my favorite <a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a> album for so many reasons. I wish I could go back to this moment at my 21st birthday and tell her one day she’ll legitimately own Speak Now and we’ll get to sing together on one of the songs.”</p><p>On the day it released, she posted on Instagram, “It’s here. It’s yours, it’s mine, it’s ours. It’s an album I wrote alone about the whims, fantasies, heartaches, dramas and tragedies I lived out as a young woman between 18 and 20. I remember making tracklist after tracklist, obsessing over the right way to tell the story. I had to be ruthless with my choices, and I left behind some songs I am still unfailingly proud of now. Therefore, you have 6 From The Vault tracks! I recorded this album when I was 32 (and still growing up, now) and the memories it brought back filled me with nostalgia and appreciation. For life, for you, for the fact that I get to reclaim my work. Thank you a million times, for the memories that break our fall. 💥🐉🏰 Speak Now (MY VERSION!) is out now.”</p><p>In the exclusive Target version of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), you get stunning 3 Target-exclusive Lilac marbled color vinyl discs, a collectible album jacket with unique front and back cover art, collectible album sleeves including lyrics and never-before-seen photos, and a full size gatefold photograph and prologue.</p><p>Don’t have a record player? No worries, because Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) also has a CD version with all 22 original reworked songs from the 2010 album and 6 Songs From The Vault. Both albums will be released on July 7, 2023, but it’s best to pre-order now for all your “Enchanted” dreams to come true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/speak-now-taylors-version-vinyl.png><p>Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) Vinyl could be the Midnight’s vinyl’s little sister with the way that the lilac casts its shade around the vinyl.
