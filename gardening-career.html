One of the things that drew me to this area was its mild winters, which let me enjoy the outdoors almost year-round. Living here, I started to recognize a pull toward gardens and flowers. Being a city kid who grew up in housing complexes and played in concrete playgrounds, I always felt that nature held a kind of otherworldliness that I found intimidating. Now in my early 30s, I am drawn more and more to this world. I'm registering for some horticulture classes this spring and feel both excited and animated. What appeals to me most is the idea of garden design and floral arrangement. My fantasy is to transition out of my office job and into these fields. My friends think it's great but caution that I may be subjecting myself to a life of financial hardship. I need to find out what I can realistically expect from this career path: I'm not pursuing this to try to get rich or even to be a designer of the stars; I'd just like to know what an average person should expect. What avenues should I investigate? How much schooling is really necessary? Is it advisable to take classes in interior architecture/design or sculpture to study color, form, placement, etc.? Have you heard of any good design programs in the San Francisco Bay Area? The only garden design program I know of is UC Berkeley's two-year certificate program. It's a bit pricey (averages over $500 a class). Is such a program advisable? I'll greatly appreciate any advice you can provide!</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong>Aysha Fernandez, Berkeley, CA</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Dear Aysha,</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">People ask me all the time about how to get started in the field of landscaping and landscape design. It is an alluring world, to be sure: It's a rare and wonderful thing to be able to combine your vocation and avocation into a single, moneymaking occupation. The problem is, it's also a crowded world, full of a lot of people who often really don't know what they are doing. In most states, for example, you can call yourself a landscaper by just picking up a shovel, and a landscape designer by just grabbing a measuring tape and plugging in a computer design program. (The title "landscape architect," on the other hand, is a credentialed degree and is generally regulated.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">All this makes for a lot of competition, often from some fairly dubious quarters. There's another issue as well: A large portion of the public values lowest cost over quality, so landing a job with a client who has the means and desire to allow you to execute your vision exactly as you see it is a fairly rare proposition. Add to this the fact that landscaping is a completely discretionary budget item, being one of the first things to go in an economic downturn. Thus, choosing the field of landscape contracting/design for a career can be a fairly iffy financial proposition, at least until you've developed a reputation for quality work, and a strong client base. Once you are established, of course, landscaping and landscape design can be quite remunerative. In the end, like so many other things, success really depends on a combination of talent and the luck of the draw.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">So I suppose my answer is this: If you truly feel inspired, follow your dream. Do, however take as many classes as you can ($500 a class at Berkeley seems a very good bargain, by the way) and seek out as many educational opportunities as possible, keeping in mind that one of the best ways to learn is through hands-on experience. Knowledge of related fields, like architecture and interior design, is also extremely valuable, as good landscape design is really about combining house and garden in a unified whole. Like an artist in front of a canvas, the more "colors" you can add to your palette, in terms of exposure and training, the more successful you'll ultimately be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfnK6zsMSnoKefX5yus7DEp2SinJWWwHC9jJqlnWWRZK55fI6gmKuclaO2r7OMnJirnZWnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cherry-raisin-christmas-bark.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make Cherry-Raisin Christmas Bark</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-walliams-dating-playboy-model-20676705.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Walliams 'secretly dating Playboy model Emily Agnes'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
