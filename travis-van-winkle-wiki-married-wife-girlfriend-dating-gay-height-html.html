The American actor and model, Winkle has a such number&nbsp;of movies and TV series enough to make any actor jealous.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His famous roles include as Trent DeMarco in “Transformers” which was interestingly portrayed again in another movie called “Friday the 13th”. It may be his luck out of nowhere or the fact of same directors in both movie, but he has bagged the feat under his name. &nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Movies:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The audience has already well zoomed his talent in his two movies like “Transformers” and “Friday the 13th”. His skills have widened his Hollywood space further to films like “247F”, “Last Call,” “Bloodwork.” His other notable appearances such as ‘Happy Endings,’ ‘2 Broke Girls’ and ‘Two and a Half Men’ has added his fame to audience scope. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Philanthropy:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Despite his popularity and busy schedule, the actor takes his time out for charity and philanthropic works. He was recently appointed as Global Ambassador of “buildOn,” a charity that takes US inner city youth to build schools in global communities.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His work had not a stop there, but he further partnered with Tiltify to present “Lovelife: Livestream” a globally live-streamed fundraising event that raised over $1000,000 to build three schools in Senegal, Africa. The program triggered the partnership between BigBrother’s/BigSisters Los Angeles and buildOn. About his philanthropic works, he quoted in one of his interviews</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I’m amazed how much money we have raised so far. Thank You. I love seeing people support such a great cause."</p><p style=text-align:justify>The actor has just opened another warm side of him with his social works and made his way to the bottom of fans hearts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>How much is Travis’s Net Worth?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>His net worth has remained away from the public’s eye, however, his financial ground can be speculated through his series of movie and TV works. His recent interest in philanthropy also suggests his good economy kept for himself.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Flaunting his Dating Life on Instagram!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>It may not take Travis himself but his Instagram to come out for his dating life. His Instagram has been way more colorful through the pictures of his girlfriend, Jessica Kemejuk. His love life indeed takes the other angles and curiosities like being gay out of the film. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><br>Caption: Travis Van Winkle with his girlfriend, Jessica.&nbsp;<br>Source: Instagram</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Married or Not?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>As for marriage, he is still running in his dating period and has not expressed any emotions towards marriage already. It might be the matter of time for Travis to make Jessie his wife or maybe there might be other sides in their relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The actor was born on November 4, 1982, in Victorville, CA and currently ages 35 years old. He grew up with his parents in Peachtree, Georgia and migrated to Los Angeles at age twenty. He has the fortunate height of 6’ (1.83 m). He has one older brother and one younger sister as siblings.
