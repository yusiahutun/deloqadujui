A pair of Frame denim jeans. A compliment whispered by a Gossip Girl. An explanation of that random new app called Instagram. Speed to 2022, and most everything, from a celebrity shoutout to a “sold out” status bag, can be double-clicked into existence—past and future trends included.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ve only been buying vintage clothes for the past three years,” said a Gen Z Cool Girl™ this morning. (She asked to remain anonymous, because her fast fashion ad campaigns depend, quite literally, on encouraging her followers to shop.) “I wish I could say I only buy resale for the environment. Really I’m just bored. There’s nothing new out there.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then the lights dimmed, and suddenly—to quote Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast—there might be something there that wasn’t there before. Namely, some actual newness on the runways that can transfer its magic into the world of real people, instead of just lingering as a magazine tear-out on a vision board. Here’s where we found it.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Saint Sintra</strong><br></h2><img alt="saint sintra" title="Saint Sintra" width=2013 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss-1644776030.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Saint Sintra</span><p>Two looks from Saint Sintra that we can't stop admiring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What happens when newness comes with a past life?

The Brooklyn-based designer turns her hauls of used textiles into brand new pieces that combine feminine whimsy with the knife-edge tailoring Martins learned from her previous Thom Browne internship.

The thing is, this New York designer was educated in Milan—something she made loud and clear in her latest collection. Pastel tweed minis and faux fur trim may have harkened back to Jawbreaker and Clueless, but beneath the TikTok party vibes, there was leatherwork and bodices more suitable for Prada ads and Barneys splurges. (RIP.) Check out Maggie Rizer in Tom Ford for Gucci (1999) next to Shui’s latest runway look and you’ll get the idea of where she might go. (Memo to Kim: YES! GO THERE!)</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Maisie Wilen</strong></h2><img alt="new york, new york february 12 designer maisie wilen poses during the maisie wilen presentation during new york fashion week the shows at chelsea factory on february 12, 2022 in new york city photo by dimitrios kambourisgetty images for nyfw the shows" title="Maisie Wilen - Presentation - February 2022 New York Fashion Week: The Shows" width=3616 height=2411 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1370208475.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dimitrios Kambouris</span><p>Designer Maisie Wilen in front of her holograms</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While “The Metaverse” keeps trying to be A Thing™, Maisie Wilen has found a way to do her thing in two places at once—online and IRL, that is. The emerging designer and CFDA nominee paired with Yahoo’s Ryot Labs on massive holograms—some human, some elfin—that modeled Wilen’s cling-wrap dresses and gossamer trench coats. The setup was dense with QR codes and shopping extensions (this was a Yahoo production, after all) but the real “whoa” came from Wilen’s canny handiwork of blending rave-ready unitards with carved cut-out denim and debutante dress seemingly made from sheets of discarded plastic. The Metaverse could never.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Christian Siriano</strong></h2><img alt="english model karen elson walks the runway for christian siriano during new york fashion week the shows at empire state building on february 12, 2022 in new york city photo by angela weiss afp photo by angela weissafp via getty images" title=FASHION-US-SIRIANO width=3984 height=2650 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1238427082.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ANGELA WEISS</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>I only have one photo in my hands and it’s of Karen Elson at Christian Siriano. Bow down.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to fabrics, Christian Siriano is kind of like Hermione Granger when she levitates a feather—such a wiz that he’ll show off his tailoring skills at every opportunity. This time around, the newness was in the level of restraint, at least in some pieces. Denim was cinched; cutouts were shaped like daggers; the relaxed cobalt suiting got big cheers from Drew Barrymore in the front row because she’ll probably wear it. That meant the grand finale—a face off between Coco Rocha and Karen Elson in massive evening gowns—had more time to crescendo. And front row fans like Ted Lasso's Hannah Waddingham and Susan Sarandon had more time to cheer from the sidelines. (Which they did. Loudly.) Dibs on that denim, though, seriously.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>PatBo</strong></h2><img alt="sophia reising, pritika swarup, olivia palermo, nicky hilton" title=PatBo width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/patbo-1644777257.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">BFA</span><p>Pretty isn't boring: a walking discourse at PatBo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s a certain kind of creative discourse that dismisses “pretty” things as innately unworthy, but I’m going to call bullshit and use Patricia Bonaldi as proof. The Brazilian designer trains and employs hundreds of her hometown’s residents, combining traditional South American macrame and needlework with newer materials like denim, neoprene, and even recycled netting. The results land in bombshell territory—cutout dresses and super-sheer tops included—but with new forays into embroidered denim separates and quilted velvet jackets, this isn’t “just” a resort wear line; it’s a growing point of view.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>LoveShackFancy</strong></h2><img alt=loveshackfancy title=LoveShackFancy width=2700 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-34017-4626553-1644777333.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">BFA</span><p>Haitian model Aube Joliecoeur at the Plaza Hotel, and yes, that's a lot of ruffles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's been a big year for Rebecca Hessel Cohen, the founder of the label that asks, "What if Marie Antoinette got out of France, moved to the beach and just, like, chilled?" Cohen'sfrilly floral miniskirts and oversized pastel cardigans have become a multi-million dollar empire, scored a Target collection, and spawned their own home line. (Every "love shack" needs a $200 pink duvet cover, bien sur.) To celebrate her success, Cohen threw a 40th birthday party at the Plaza Hotel that doubled as a campaign—and enlisted party princess like Lily Chee (in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.loveshackfancy.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/karlina-mini-dress-pastel-pink-colorblock-d1411-1040 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="see-now-buy-now moment" data-vars-ga-product-id=19e10a2a-87d0-4f40-9b3b-b548477ead44 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.loveshackfancy.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/karlina-mini-dress-pastel-pink-colorblock-d1411-1040 data-product-url=https://www.loveshackfancy.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/karlina-mini-dress-pastel-pink-colorblock-d1411-1040 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loveshackfancy.com%2Fcollections%2Fnew-arrivals%2Fproducts%2Fkarlina-mini-dress-pastel-pink-colorblock-d1411-1040" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=LoveShackFancy data-vars-ga-product-price=$275.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=6b303d4b-d914-440d-9f16-9ad731197b1b data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=LoveShackFancy class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">see-now-buy-now moment</a>) and Aube Joliecoeur. Again, it's easy to say "So what?" because there's no disruption in a frilly party dress, but guess what? This is a woman who's ethically making clothes that other women want, and unfortunately, even in 2022, that's still news. Also, it's okay—even cool!—to embrace the radical softness of girly clothes.
