I watched her from home in Hong Kong, in awe.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">ONE: Chatri pays tribute to Victoria Lee after death at 18</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An understandable sadness has been cast over January 14’s event now. Eighteen is just too young, and especially for someone so prodigiously gifted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That was even her nickname – “The Prodigy” – and an apt moniker it was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/12a71727-d76a-4752-8391-28c764428c6f_5c60d7de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victoria Sun-hei Lee was born on May 17, 2004 in Wahiawa, Hawaii, to Chinese-Singaporean father Ken Lee, who would later become her coach, and South-Korean-born Canadian mother Jewelz Lee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They lived in Mililani, where it was a family affair to say the least, with her two world champion siblings Angela and Christian, and their respective spouses Bruno Pucci and Katie Lee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A fourth Lee sibling is also coming off the production line – her 17-year-old brother Adrian Lee won an amateur MMA title in Hilo, Hawaii, on December 18. Victoria posed for a photo with him, in her final Instagram post, after his victory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Super proud of my little bro,” she wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was also a proud aunt to one-year-old nieces, Ava Marie Pucci and Alia Mae Lee, who wore born within weeks of each other in April 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was lucky enough to give a 16-year-old Victoria her first interview, in September 2020 after she signed with ONE. I was asked by ONE’s PR to send my questions ahead of time. She was understandably nervous, but still seemed remarkably composed for someone of her age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have very big shoes to fill,” she told me, with that big, trademark smile. She was always smiling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Angela, who was pregnant with Ava Marie at the time, soon told me her younger sister was even better than she was at the same age. Quite something, given that the ONE atomweight queen became the youngest MMA world champion in history, aged 19, in May 2016.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No way, no way,” Victoria told me. “My sister, she’s very … no. She’s way better than me, I can’t accept that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/c7f0ae55-57bc-41e3-b89c-eea8a8821b5e_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victoria made her professional MMA debut with ONE in February 2021, defeating Thailand’s Sunisa Srisen by submission with a rear-naked choke in just over a minute.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was very impressed with Victoria’s incredible performance,” ONE chairman and CEO Chatri Sityodtong said after the fight. “I still can’t believe Victoria is only 16 years old. When I was 16 years old, I couldn’t even tie my shoelaces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She definitely lived up to the hype. Without a doubt, Victoria Lee is the next big thing in martial arts.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her second fight came in July the same year. She scored another quick submission with an armbar against China’s Wang Luping in less than four minutes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She made her third walk to the ONE Circle two months later, and it was a familiar tale – she defeated Victoria Souza of Brazil by first-round TKO.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/1eb6c1e3-f0d9-43dc-b622-593f34f701d4_d8cac2a8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I interviewed Victoria Lee five times in all. She was always impossibly polite and disarmingly nice – at complete odds with the mean-mugging beast who blitzed through her opposition in the ONE Circle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She put the brakes on her burgeoning fighting career after that third victory to focus on graduating from Mililani High School, where she was a popular student and got good grades, in June 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was fighting throughout the school year, it was definitely pretty difficult to juggle, like the timing of school and training, as well as the homework,” she said at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So now, it’s nice to have all that time in the day just to train. Now I get to focus on just training and it’s just a way more enjoyable experience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The break also seemed to have done her some good in other ways, according to her older brother, who felt she was rejuvenated ahead of her impending return to action.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Fighting three times, being so active at such a young age. I think it’s good to just take some time off, just relax, get away from the sport,” Christian said of his younger sister in a recent interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Then when it comes back to you, when you have the fire, when you wanna go back into the Circle and you take another fight. That’s what happened with Victoria.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/82ba19e8-04e2-434d-b54d-c9e5dce0c1ad_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even though she wasn’t fighting, she was still training harder than anyone at her family’s United MMA gym.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m really proud of how hard she’s working every day,” Christian said last year. “She’s really just putting her head down and just putting in the work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She’s in the gym for like six hours a day. She’s training more hours than any of us. Between me and my sister [Angela], [Victoria’s] really just always in the gym, always working and I think it’s really showing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It really did look like we were going to see an upgraded “Victoria Lee 2.0” in Bangkok – a scary prospect for everyone in her division.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/0e4df1e7-7d64-4cd2-ae1b-e66a62c4b498_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But now we will not see how good she would have been. We will not see her lift that world title in the air, or set those records she would have set.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following in Angela and Christian’s footsteps would certainly have been daunting, but few people in the know doubt that Victoria would have been a future champion in ONE.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A prodigy, indeed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everyone in the ONE Championship world will miss Victoria Lee. Her time in the Circle was brief, but beautiful. We are all lucky we got to watch her and get to know her as much as we did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mppmiqbaiuIyaqa2rX6K2ubHDZqSaqqSerq15wKurrGeRp8Gqr8ueZmxqYGt9dYWOr6CcrJ%2BntqJ5y56cZqukpL%2B6ec6nnGabmJa6sbXOp6qhoaCoerG%2Bzp2goLFdrLWweceaqmacmZqxbn2XZrCemaKoerC4ww%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-anya-taylor-joy-4337752.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Anya Taylor-Joy? 5 Things About The Queens Gambit Star Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-mcgraw-small-town-racism-jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim McGraw Says His Small Hometown Doesn't Tolerate Racism</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
