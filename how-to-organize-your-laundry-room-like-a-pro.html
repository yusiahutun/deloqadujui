Banging into dryer racks? Having trouble fitting your fabric softener in among the piles of clean and dirty clothes, bed sheets or towels? Taking the time now to create an organized space (or to make room for what you truly need in the room) can not only save you time in the long run, but it can make doing your laundry a much easier task, whether it’s your favorite chore to do or you dread that looming day every week. And it’s easy enough to do without spending a lot of money, time or energy, say organizing pros. Here, their top laundry room storage ideas for even the tiniest of spaces, so laundry day is always a breeze!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Laundry room storage ideas: Air-dry this way</h2><p>Whether you’re trying to save money by skipping the dryer or a<a href=#> garment’s care tag</a> says to keep it out of the appliance, the one thing that takes up a lot of space in many of our laundry rooms (or the one thing many of us have the least space for!) is air drying. Setting up your drying racks or space is key to ensuring there is room to store what you need in the room.</p><p>One note regardless of what method you choose: “When setting up your drying area, ensure there’s enough room between garments to allow for proper air circulation and faster drying times,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shantae Duckworth</a>, professional organizer and founder of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Shantaeize Your Space</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a>&nbsp;Read on for three smart ideas:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Choose collapsible drying racks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/GettyImages-1492295925-1.jpg><p>If you don’t have much&nbsp;floor space, you may be wondering how you can air-dry clothes without tripping over a drying track. The trick? “Use fold-down drying racks (and ironing boards) that can be tucked away when not in use,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bridget Flynn</a>, home organizer and owner of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Divine Organizing</a>. You can also install retractable racks that can be extended for drying and pushed flat against the wall after laundry day.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Opt for a valet hook</h3><p>Don’t air-dry clothing often? You may want a fixture that’s a bit more simplistic. “A wall-mounted, flip-down valet hook is ideal for hanging shirts fresh out of the dryer to avoid wrinkles or for air-drying anything you don’t want to put in the dryer,” shares&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Gabai</a>, founder of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">B. Organized</a>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Art of Organizing: An Artful Guide to an Organized Life</a>. You’ll still be able to fold it against the wall when not in use, but it won’t take up as much room otherwise.</p><p>(Click through for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more smart air-drying hacks</a>.)</p><p>The video below shows one genius option:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Try a ceiling rack</h3><p>Anyone working with a particularly crowded or small laundry room may believe air-drying clothes is out of the question. The clever solution: “Utilize ceiling-mounted racks to hang clothes,” advises Flynn. “This saves floor space and can be particularly useful in small areas.”</p><p>If you’re looking to save money, consider making your own ceiling-mounted rack using PVC pipes, which can be seen in the video below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Laundry room storage ideas: Organize supplies</h2><p>Bottles and boxes of detergent, dryer sheets, stain remover and more can lead to plenty of extra clutter in your laundry room. Since these supplies are a must, you may be wondering how you can keep them handy without creating a mess as well as how to make them fit in a smaller space. Below, you’ll find five great organizing secrets.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Think vertically</h3><p>One of the biggest problems with supplies is it may feel like there’s just nowhere to put them. “Look for vertical storage solutions like shelves or wall-mounted cabinets to keep essentials within reach without taking up precious floor space,” says Duckworth. What’s more, this will keep supplies at eye level so you can easily find the item you need.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Create a “countertop”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/self.jpg><p>No cabinets above the washer and dryer? Rather than pile everything on top of your appliances, professional organizer<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Rachel Rosenthal</a> suggests hanging a pair of wooden shelves as a low-cost alternative. “These shelves will store about as much as a cabinet and they’ll free up space on top of appliances, giving you a ‘counter’ for folding and pre-treating.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Try stackable bins</h3><p>Placing laundry items on shelves is a great storage solution, but you may find that you’re still pressed for space. In this case, stackable bins can be used on the shelves to fit everything in one place.</p><p>Open-front bins are one ideal option. “I employ these for frequently used items, like cleaning rags, dryer sheets and delicates bags,” says Flynn. “They should be put in easy-to-reach areas.” Flynn loves <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">these</a> stackable bins from Amazon for this purpose.</p><p>If you store extra items in your laundry room that aren’t used frequently or have a non-laundry purpose, opt for lidded stackable bins. Then stick them on the top shelves you don’t need to access often. Note: “It’s important to label these bins, so you can see where everything is at a glance,” she adds.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Grab a lazy Susan</h3><p>Shelves or cabinets that are wider mean more storage room, but that also can make it tougher to grab what you need. Plus, if you can’t keep track of your inventory, you may end up accidentally purchasing more stain remover or dryer sheets when you already have them but can’t see them!</p><p>The save: “Lazy-Susans are great for storing things to prevent them from being forgotten when they’re far on the back of the shelf,” says Gabai. Watch the video below to see how it can work for you:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Downsize when possible</h3><p>Buying laundry items in bulk is a great way to save money in the long run, but those large packages can quickly make things cluttered or take up way too much space. A better way: “Transfer bulk products into smaller, easily handled containers or mason jars to save space and keep the area neat,” advises Flynn. This will also allow you to add them to bins and group like items together in your cabinet or on a shelf.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Experts Share Why Using Too Much Laundry Detergent May Be Making Your Clothes ‘Dirty’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Laundry room storage ideas: Enlist unused spaces</h2><p>You may have more space than you think! Here are three “hidden” spots that can hold more storage:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Fill in an awkward gap</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/gap.jpg><p>Outsmart that narrow space between appliances with a skinny set of drawers that makes your space more efficient, says Rosenthal. Stash smaller must-haves, like dryer sheets and stain sticks inside.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Look behind the door</h3><p><strong>“</strong>A hidden storage opportunity is the space behind the door,” shares Gabai. “See if a narrow, but tall set of shelves with a low front face can be mounted on the wall.” You could also use an over-the-door organizer. The large collection of pockets is a perfect way to hold everything from dryer balls to clothespins!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Check the wall</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/GettyImages-1276701203-1.jpg><p>If you’re someone who likes to keep cleaning supplies handy in your laundry room, it can be tough to find a spot for those items without taking up the valuable real estate you need for laundry items. But it can be done! Once again, the key is to think vertically. “Hang mops, brooms and dust pans on the walls” adds Gabai.</p><p><strong>For more organization secrets, keep reading!</strong></p><p><a href=#>Organizing Pro’s Genius Shower Caddy Hack Frees Up Closet Space + More Storage Tips</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The File Folder Hack That Keeps Your Linen Closet Organized + More Brilliant Tips</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">10 Small Closet Organizing Hacks From Pro Organizers That Will Change Your Life</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon6illWS1sMOMraZmp6Kcrq%2B12Z5ksqelp3qtrdSnm6uxXae8sLmMpaCknV2WerG%2Bzg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./red-and-blue-light-therapy-at-home.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Red and Blue Light Therapy At Home: A Complete Guide</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessie-james-and-reggie-bush.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessie James and Reggie Bush</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
