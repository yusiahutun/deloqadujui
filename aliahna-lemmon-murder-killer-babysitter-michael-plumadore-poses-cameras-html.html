After that call, he realised the door to the home was unlocked and that Aliahna was gone. He said Aliahna's six-year-old sisters told him Aliahna had left with her mom.</span></p><p><span>Plumadore said it wasn't until he talked with Aliahna's mother at about 8:30pm that they realised she was missing and police were notified.</span></p><p><span>Accompanying the story was a photography of Plumadore on Christmas Day, in his Trailer in Fort Wayne. He is sitting next to the chair where he says nine-year-old Aliahna Lemmon was last seen sleeping.

This is one of those things that you will never forget,' Sheriff Fries told the Mail Online.</span></p><p><span>In 30 years of law enforcement, he said, he has never seen anything like what happened to Aliahna.
