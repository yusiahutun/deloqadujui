That includes one of TV’s most famous fictional families. Over nearly 10 years on <a href=#>CBS</a>, the <a href=#>characters in The Waltons</a> came together for a handful of Turkey Day meals. But the show only aired one official Thanksgiving special during its nine-season run: 1973’s two-part episode The Thanksgiving Story.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘The Waltons: The Thanksgiving Story’ aired in season 2</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you to The Waltons for 10 years of laughter, tears, and hope throughout the years on INSP.</p><p>The Waltons A Thanksgiving Story, November 24th at 7a ET. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vZ7XXUhWyQ</a></p>— INSP (@insp_tv) <a href=#>October 28, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-2_44>The Walton family made their TV debut with The Homecoming: A Christmas Story. The 1971 holiday-focused made-for-TV movie about a family <a href=#>celebrating Christmas during the Great Depression</a> was such a hit with audiences that CBS quickly ordered a TV series featuring the same characters.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_54>The Waltons premiered in September 1972. One of its first episodes was “The Hunt.” While not specifically centered around Thanksgiving, the episode does deal with John-Boy Walton’s (Richard Thomas) desire to help his father John (Ralph Waite) provide for the family. At the same, John-Boy struggles with his reluctance to kill a wild turkey.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_14>The show tackled the Thanksgiving holiday directly in season 2 with “The Thanksgiving Story.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_57>“Next to Christmas, I suppose you’d have to say that Thanksgiving was our favorite time of the year,” a grown-up John-Boy (Earl Hamner Jr.) says in the episode’s voiceover. “We may have been poor in worldly possessions but, at Thanksgiving, more than any other time, I think we knew, we really knew, how great was our abundance.”</p><p id=par-6_58>The two-hour episode centers on John-Boy, whose dreams of going to college are nearly derailed when he suffers a life-threatening head injury. Meanwhile, his sister Mary Ellen auditions for the Thanksgiving play, Jason (Jon Walmsley) gets a job helping the Baldwin sisters make their moonshine, and Ben (Eric Scott) helps Grandpa (Will Geer) hunt for the Thanksgiving turkey.</p><h2>There were two ‘Waltons’ Thanksgiving reunion movies&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-7_68>The Waltons continued to air on CBS until 1981. After it was canceled, the original cast came together for several reunion movies. Two of those focused on Thanksgiving. In 1982, A Day for Thanks on Walton Mountain aired. It’s set in 1947 and sees the youngest Walton sibling <a href=#>Elizabeth (Kami Cotler)</a> worrying that the day just won’t feel special if the whole family can’t come together to celebrate.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_37>In 1993, the Waltons cast reunited one more time for A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion. This TV movie is set in 1963 and sees the clan celebrating the holiday in the wake of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_38>This year, the Waltons again came together to give thanks. <a href=#>The CW’s A Waltons Thanksgiving</a> aired Nov. 20 and featured a new cast of actors in the roles of John, Olivia, John-Boy, and the rest of the family.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-where-to-stream-the-thanksgiving-story-and-the-waltons-thanksgiving-movies>Where to stream ‘The Thanksgiving Story’ and ‘The Waltons’ Thanksgiving movies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_30>Want to spend your Thanksgiving with The Waltons?
