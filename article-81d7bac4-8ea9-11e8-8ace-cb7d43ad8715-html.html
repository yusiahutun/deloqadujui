Allison Doughty snapped the picture, and more than a quarter-century later, she still has vivid memories of her visit with Col. David and Mary Ellen Senne.</p><p><span>“She was a saint, in my opinion,&nbsp;for domestic animals,” said Allison Doughty Jehlicka, now a photographer in North Carolina. “Many of her animals then had missing limbs or other problems and she spent fortunes on caring for them and giving them a&nbsp;</span>good quality of life when they would have been killed.</p><p><span>“Several cats and at least one dog had scooters that she attached to allow them to be mobile again.”</span></p><p><span>The Sennes were arrested Monday and charged with aggravated animal&nbsp;</span><span>cruelty after the Jones County Sheriff’s&nbsp;</span><span>Department, Southern Cross Animal Rescue, the Mississippi Department&nbsp;of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and&nbsp;</span>the Humane Society of the United States found 106 animals — 17 of them dead in a freezer — on their 161-acre property on Lyon Ranch Road in the Johnson Community, just outside of Ellisville.</p><p><span>More than 50 officials and volun</span><span>teers from across the country went to their property on the morning of July&nbsp;</span><span>11 and seized 89 live animals —55 dogs and 34 cats—that were being housed in what&nbsp;</span><span>Sheriff Alex Hodge and others&nbsp;</span><span>called “deplorable conditions.” Many of the animals</span><span>were suffering from neglect, he and rescue officials said.</span><span>The animals were housed&nbsp;</span>in six separate structures&nbsp;<span data-mce-mark=1>on her property, which was&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>known as “Wonderland.” It’s been referred to as an animal sanctuary inside a theme park&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>because there’s a carousel,&nbsp;</span>a ferris wheel, a pirate ship,&nbsp;<span data-mce-mark=1>a steamboat, a caboose and&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>numerous unusual statues throughout the property.</span></p><p><span>Officials describe a scene</span><span>that sounds like anything but a sanctuary for animals.</span></p><p><span>Hodge said the most grue</span><span>some thing he saw was a small dog “with its back end basically eaten out by maggots.” No&nbsp;</span><span>images of that were released, though, because “no one wants to see that,” Hodge said.&nbsp;</span><span>Members of the local media were not allowed on the property and they were only able to get glimpses of a few of the</span><span>dogs that were being exam</span><span>ined under tents, surrounded&nbsp;</span><span>by caregivers.</span></p><p><span>“Today is their last day living&nbsp;</span><span>a hell,” Stacy Thrash of SCAR</span><span>said in a live interview during the seizure.</span></p><p><span>Jehlicka said the animals&nbsp;</span><span>had a heavenly existence in their home in Hattiesburg.</span></p><p><span>“Her house was immaculate&nbsp;</span><span>and very clean despite all the&nbsp;</span><span>animals,” she said.</span></p><p><span>She recalled that there was a downstairs room just for cats</span><span>— “again, very clean,” she said.</span></p><p><span>“Another thing that im</span><span>pressed me was that she had adopted a needy family — a single mom with kids — and bought her groceries regularly.”</span></p><p><span>Several days after the&nbsp;</span><span>first story about Senne was published in the Hattiesburg American, an article with the&nbsp;</span><span>headline “Soft spot for animals puts activist in hot spot”&nbsp;</span><span>appeared. Hattiesburg code administrator Jerry Creel sent two animal control officers&nbsp;</span><span>to her home to warn her that she had to remove 50 animals from her residence. That’s because city code only allowed&nbsp;</span><span>residential homes to have six&nbsp;</span><span>animals.</span></p><p><span>Neighbors and city officials&nbsp;</span><span>were not aware of all the animals the Sennes had until they saw the newspaper article a</span><span>bout her. Officials tried to&nbsp;</span><span>work with her to resolve the problem.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not asking for any spe</span><span>cial consideration,” Senne said&nbsp;</span><span>at the time. “That’s not me. I&nbsp;</span><span>fight for people who don’t get special consideration, but if&nbsp;</span><span>anything can be done to legally&nbsp;</span><span>resolve this, that would be&nbsp;</span><span>good.”</span></p><p><span>City officials considered&nbsp;</span><span>rezoning the property so she could continue to house the animals on her property.</span></p><p><span>“It is out of compassion that&nbsp;</span><span>she took these animals in ... we don’t provide the type of fa</span><span>cility that could handle them,” then-City Councilwoman Betsy Rowell said, noting that&nbsp;</span><span>no neighbors had complained about the situation. “These&nbsp;</span><span>are animals that would be eu</span><span>thanized. It’s sad, but nobody&nbsp;</span><span>wants these animals. That’s the reason that she has them.”</span></p><p><span>Then-Mayor Ed Morgan</span><span>also weighed in, saying, “I&nbsp;</span><span>think there is a way we ought to be able to work with somepne like Mrs. Senne who is doing something special and&nbsp;</span><span>different.”</span></p><p><span>The article also reported that Senne had been involved in numerous local causes. Not long before her story was publ</span><span>ished, she had worked to help&nbsp;</span><span>53 evicted families move after they had been evicted from a trailer park that was slated for demolition.</span></p><p><span>A followup article said that&nbsp;</span><span>Senne was granted more time&nbsp;</span><span>to come up with a solution,</span><span>including rezoning or applying for a kennel license.</span></p><p><span>“We are certainly sympathetic to Mrs. Senne’s egalitarian disposition and therefore are searching for ways to work&nbsp;</span><span>with her,” said Franklyn Tate,&nbsp;</span><span>city director for Urban Devel</span><span>opment, said at the time.</span></p><p><span>The followup story described most of the animals in her care</span><span>as “hard-luck pets,” many of which were “one-eyed, blind&nbsp;</span><span>or three-legged and have special needs.”</span></p><p><span>In a press conference this&nbsp;</span><span>week, Heather Williams of SCAR said that Senne took in&nbsp;</span><span>many animals that were “hard to adopt or had special needs” or they “were not thriving in&nbsp;</span><span>a shelter situation.” But when she saw the conditions they&nbsp;</span><span>were being kept in, Williams was “blown away,” she said,&nbsp;</span><span>adding that many animals were in “hidden buildings” that they weren’t aware of.</span></p><p><span>Peg Glaser of Soso, who has&nbsp;</span><span>been involved with animal rescues and has known Senne&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>for years, said, “She’s a unique&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>person. I think she maybe&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>got in deeper than she meant&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>to. She was overrun, killing&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark=1>herself taking care of them. It’s a sad situation.”</span></p><p><span>Col. Senne was a Purple Heart recipient and retired from the military. He has&nbsp;</span><span>served as a professor at the University of Southern Mis</span><span>sissippi and executive director of the Laurel-Hattiesburg Regional Airport. He also&nbsp;</span>had a failed run for mayor&nbsp;<span>of Hattiesburg. He suffers&nbsp;</span><span>from dementia now and was&nbsp;</span><span>under the care of his wife, in&nbsp;</span><span>addition to the dogs and cats. Mary Ellen Senne told Judge Billie Graham that she and her husband own rental property&nbsp;</span><span>in Jones, Forrest and Lamar&nbsp;</span><span>counties.</span></p><p><span>Receipts show that she spent almost $3,500 on dog and cat&nbsp;</span><span>food over the last four months.</span></p><p><span>Hodge said that the raid was&nbsp;</span><span>the result of a three-month investigation into possible animal cruelty and neglect. Senne told reporters that she spent&nbsp;</span><span>“$6,000 to $10,000 a month”&nbsp;</span><span>on veterinarian bills. Dr. Kimberly Marnin disputed that&nbsp;</span><span>figure, saying it was “about&nbsp;</span><span>$700” a month. Senne also said that the 17 animals that were in the freezer were being prepared for burial at a church on her property that’s by the&nbsp;</span><span>rainbow bridge, an afterlife for&nbsp;</span><span>pets that was popularized by a poem.</span></p><p><span>The Sennes have hired&nbsp;</span><span>Hattiesburg attorney Scott&nbsp;</span><span>Schwartz to represent them in their court case.</span></p><p><span>“Mary Ellen was a force of&nbsp;</span><span>goodness back then,” Jehlicka</span><span>said. “I can’t imagine she’s any&nbsp;</span><span>different now.”</span></p><p><span>•</span></p><p><span>Clarification</span></p><p><span>Buddy’s Place is an animal memorial that was established by Mary Ellen Senne at the “gateway” to the Longleaf&nbsp;</span><span>Trace, not to the University of&nbsp;</span><span>Southern Mississippi.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwv8SnpZ6rXaSzbsDHnmSpmaOpfKK%2B06KapZ2PbX6lg8Gamm1laJquenmQapxxZWiWsKZ5wptunWxjlrF5g5BuZaGsnaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shanna-ferrigno.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shanna Ferrigno</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-trujillo-19641023-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Trujillo (Bassist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
