But before she was a superstar, she was a 9-year-old, aspiring musician writing her very first song. Wilson appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show on March 16, and she treated viewers and Clarkson to a snippet of that first tune, called "Lucky Me."</p><p>While sitting with actor Zachary Levi and Clarkson on the talk show, Wilson explained that she wrote her first song while at a sleepover with a friend. The moment clearly foreshadowed her future as a singer-songwriter.</p><p>"She went to one room and I went to another, and we were like, 'Let's write a song and come back and share it with each other," Wilson recalls of the night.</p><p>"What cool 9-year-olds you were," Clarkson says. "What?"</p><p>Clarkson then asked Wilson if she'd sing a portion of the tune, and Wilson agreed, cautioning, "It ain't real good, but I'm gonna sing it for you."</p><p>She then launched into a sweet little love song with a sing-song, bubbly melody.</p><p>"Lucky me / I feel free, and I can't deny that he loves me / Which I know that he does, so he's the one / Lucky me, oh, / I said, oh / I'm the one for him / And he's the one for me, baby," she sang.</p><p>Clarkson and Levi chuckled after Wilson sang the tune and expressed their surprise, yet again, that Wilson wrote it when she was 9.</p><p>"9 years old?!" Clarkson exclaimed. The show host even added her own humorous verse to the song.</p><p>"She was like, 'You don't know it, but I'm the s--t,'" Clarkson&nbsp;sang, in a similar rhythm.</p><p>The conversation also revealed that Clarkson's first-ever song was called "Baby Blue Eyes," but unfortunately, the audience wasn't lucky enough to hear that one.</p><p>Although it's unlikely Wilson's "Lucky Me" will make its way onto her next album, the songs she wrote in her youth surely primed her for the hit songs she has released throughout her career.</p><p>Wilson is currently on her Country With a Flare Tour, which wraps March 31 in Columbus, Ohio.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 Country Artists Who Won 2022</h2><p>We know who won the 2022 ACM and CMA Awards, and we know which country artists won country radio and streaming airplay battles. Who won 2022?</p><p>That's a fairly big question, but when we asked our friends on social media, a few names came back consistently. These 10 artists elevated their careers to new heights in 2022, so while our No. 1 winner didn't spend the most weeks at No. 1 or dominate sales charts, her career took off like a rocket. Scroll down to see the full list.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 22 Country Songs of 2022, Ranked</h2>There are plenty of feel-good country jams on this list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top country songs of 2022</a>, but the No. 1 song is one of the best love songs of the decade. These 22 songs are ranked by critical acclaim, radio and sales success, and importance to the genre.Seven of the 22 artists made our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Country Songs list from 2021</a>, as well, but there are no song repeats. If a song made a previous list (or didn't spend most of its time on the charts in 2022), it's not eligible. So, before you ask where your favorite song is (i.e. Cody Johnson, "'Til You Can't"), be sure the miss isn't just a technicality.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpZmZo7K6edaio6ynnmLAqrrGZp2iqqOperS7zaBksKqfqbJut8Slo7Jlk6Gus7fSqKVmq5ikxHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./662d355d268e3ec0558b4577-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lenovo Tenerife y Unicaja luchan por la corona europea en la final ms espaola</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gwen-stefani-throws-support-behind-blake-shelton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gwen Stefani throws support behind Blake Shelton - and fans react</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
