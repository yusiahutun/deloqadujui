local culture.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She uses the image of the pineapple-bun-wielding waiter as an example of how Onodera is able to crystallise the small details of daily life in her work. “There’s a stillness to it. She’s able to capture a beautiful moment that many of us wouldn’t have even noticed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is why I wanted to showcase Onodera’s work in Hong Kong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/f80f5777-7773-4c56-a9f1-722302b49f0f_1dd2a402.jpg>Onodera will also host two talks through a Japanese/Cantonese interpreter on April 14 and April 20, sharing her thoughts on her favourite Hong Kong dishes, the relationship between Hong Kong and Japan in the 1980s and 1990s, and the trials and tribulations of trying to recreate <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cantonese cuisine</span></a> at home in Tokyo.Whether it is a simple <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">bamboo steamer</span></a> full of pearlescent shrimp dumplings, or a vignette of a teahouse as seen from the streets, there is an honesty and charm to Onodera’s paintings, which she says are purely “records” of Hong Kong life that she wishes to preserve as a visitor to the city.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Often, her sketches will feature everyday people she comes across – cooks, waiters, diners – as well as the adorable cats she encounters on her walks through the streets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Lin Heung Tea House closed down in August 2022, she posted a sketch of the restaurant with the caption, “I cried thinking of everyone’s faces and food I ate so many times”.</p>Onodera says she first fell in love with Chinese cuisine as a child growing up in Yokohama, south of Tokyo – her great-grandfather was a ship’s captain and her grandfather worked in shipping – and on the rare occasions her family dined out, they would invariably try out one of the many Chinese restaurants in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chinatown</span></a>.Eventually, she got the chance to travel to Hong Kong in 1998 – a trip to see her idol, the late singer <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing</span></a>, whose music she had discovered a year earlier. It was a visit that changed her life, and ignited an insatiable curiosity about the city’s food and culture.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other than during the Covid-19 era, Onodera would visit several times a year, each time finding new inspiration through food and nature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is also to learn about the unpretentious lifestyle of the people of Hong Kong,” she explains. “I would like to know more about home cooking. I want to know why I am so attracted to Hong Kong, especially through food.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/59a2f7a0-a110-46ab-a0d2-6e25af67b396_444fa985.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Onodera last visited Hong Kong just a few months ago, in January, where she met Word by Word’s founder Michael Lui Ka-chun; the two met more than a decade ago at a gallery in Tokyo, bonded over their love of food (back then, Lui was still the editor of Eat and Travel Weekly magazine) and have kept in touch ever since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I stayed at a friend’s house, joined her family for dinner, went for a walk in Ap Lei Chau and bought some dry ingredients for the soups I will make in Japan,” the artist says.</p>During our video call, she proudly brandishes a bottle of sweet vinegar, explaining how she bought it on a visit to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Yuet Wo Soy Sauce factory</span></a> during that trip.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/4881042c-d006-4f3a-a52f-488ede74c740_ed18453d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also shows off a haul of dried conch and morel mushrooms and shares that she also stocks up on Chinese medicinal herbs and Black and White evaporated milk whenever she comes over, despite the considerable weight it adds to her suitcase.</p>“I make my own milk tea,” she says, saying that the versions she can find in Tokyo’s few cha chaan teng-style cafes are not quite up to scratch because they use Japanese <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">evaporated milk</span></a>, which she says is not as rich or creamy. “I also blend my own tea leaves,” she adds.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Onodera has become something of an ambassador for Hong Kong in Japan, her exhibitions in Tokyo flying the flag for the city’s food culture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/aa1f5e7d-4c24-4297-bc8d-2a4193dc2b8c_2a48f19f.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/6fc43378-3587-4b93-9572-e1c2b87d41d1_384d2cb1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The illustrator says that there tends to be three types of people who come to her exhibitions in Japan. The first would be local fans of Hong Kong culture – “These are people who want to experience a bit of Hong Kong’s atmosphere even if they are in Japan,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another would be Hongkongers living in Japan. “They want to see how Japanese people express Hong Kong. I hope these people will not be disappointed. I hope to express the atmosphere and colours that are unique to Hong Kong, not the stereotypical image of Hong Kong,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The third and final category are simply passers-by – people who happen to stop by the gallery and know nothing about Hong Kong. “I want to convey to these people the charms of Hong Kong that cannot be expressed in travel guidebooks and get them interested in the city,” says Onodera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/9dd160ac-2704-4b21-81c5-0f851d2f96a5_b3f9e852.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In particular, many Japanese people are completely unaware of the differences between Taiwan and Hong Kong, so I would be happy if I could give them a taste of what kind of city it is through my paintings. Some of them said, ‘I didn’t know Hong Kong was such a city. I want to visit there.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Taste of Hong Kong Through My Eyes” by Mitsuko Onodera will be exhibited at Word by Word Book Store (1/F, Foo Tak Building, 365-367 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai) from April 13 to May 12, 2024</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9of3aEkm9qaKFdoq6ssYymsGanp6N6rrXLpGStnZFit6K8wKecrJ1dlr%2B1tdKtZKGdomK5sMLEZp%2BoppdiuLC6xmaarqGjnrumedOop6KbXZ2ys3nEsZ%2BimpmptrC6jJygrbE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-brightman-gets-lift-space-18564699.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Brightman gets lift-off for space travel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fenster-returns-to-zomba-music-group.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fenster Returns To Zomba Music Group</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
