We are at the bottom of the table.</p><p>“But having watched their last two games against Everton and Brighton, the players showed real character.</p><p>“This gave me the confidence to think we have enough here.</p><p>“It’s my job to really spark that confidence and give them structure and an edge.”</p><p>The situation facing Leicester three months into their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WSL</a> debut term is in stark contrast to their red-hot streak in the Championship last season.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Under former gaffer Jonathan Morgan, the club lost just TWO games in a storming 20-match run that saw them gain promotion to the top tier for the first time in their existence.</p><p>But it has been an entirely different story this term with Leicester becoming the third side in WSL history to lose their opening eight matches.</p><p>It is a run that led Foxes chiefs to drop the axe on Morgan’s reign.</p><p>But Bedford is confident their current form can be reversed.</p><p>And the team had a boost from a Conti Cup penalty shootout triumph over Manchester United with the Foxes winning 4-3 via spot-kicks.</p><p>I look at what Hope (Powell) has done at Brighton, and she has been given time and she's grown it gradually</p><span class=quote-credit>Lydia Bedford</span><p>“It was brilliant for the girls, and they really deserved it.
