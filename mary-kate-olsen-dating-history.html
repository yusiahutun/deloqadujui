For those who don’t know, the Olsen twin filed for divorce from her husband of five years, <a href=# id=auto-tag_olivier-sarkozy data-tag=olivier-sarkozy>Olivier Sarkozy</a>, in May. Olivier and Mary-Kate, who have a 17-year age difference, married in November 2015 after three years of dating.</p><p>However, by April 2020, their relationship seemed to have soured after Mary-Kate filed to <a href=# rel=noopener>divorce her husband</a>. Due to the 2020 health crisis, the courts in New York City, where Mary-Kate and Olivier lived, wouldn’t look at the Full House alum’s filing because it wasn’t an emergency. And so in May, Mary-Kate filed for an emergency divorce from her husband after his lawyers <a href=# rel=noopener>sent her an email</a>, telling her that she needed to move out of their New York City apartment by May 18, 2020, according to TMZ. Due to New York City health guidelines at that time, Mary-Kate responded, asking for the deadline to be extended to May 30. When she didn’t hear a response, Mary-Kate filed for an emergency divorce, and here we are! Since the news, Mary-Kate has been <a href=# rel=noopener>staying with her sister</a>, Ashley Olsen, at her twin’s home outside of New York City.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mary-Kate-Olsen-Olivier-Sarkozy.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mary-kate-olsen.jpg><p>Not sure what will happen with her divorce from Olivier, but here’s her dating history to make sense of everything that happened before her marriage.</p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>David Katzenberg (2003 – 2004)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/david-katzenberg.jpg><p>David, the son of DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg, was one of MK’s first relationships in the spotlight.

According to Access, Mary-Kate was one of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">first people called</a> when the actor’s masseuse found him dead in his bedroom. Per reports, the masseuse knew that MK and Heath were close friends and her number was in his phone on speed dial. MK was also the one who called the paramedics when the masseuse suspected that the actor died.</p><p>“[They were]<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> casually dating</a> for three months before Heath’s death.

MK met him in 2012 and by November 2015, the two had married in private ceremony in New York City. However, after five years of marriage, she filed for divorce in April 2020. While they were together, the couple received some criticism for their 17-year age difference, but a source told E! News at the time they didn’t pay any attention to the haters.</p><p>“<a href=# rel=noopener>Mary-Kate is just 27</a> but comes across as a lot, lot younger,” the source said. “She’s clearly very excited about the chance to get married to a very successful, well-educated man, but life isn’t always that simple. He’s already got kids and is very happy with his status in life.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/entertainment-banner.jpg alt="StyleCaster Entertainment News Letter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2idnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfHJ9kHFocHFfoq6zxYykmK2dXaS5tLHNZpuarJmjtG60yKyrqKqpZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leighton-meester-helped-sur-hostess-billie-lee-transition-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leighton Meester helped SUR hostess Billie Lee transition</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./asm-global-announces-an-exclusive-booking-partnership-at-the-laughlin-event-center-and-the-edge-pavilion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>ASM Global Announces An Exclusive Booking Partnership At The Laughlin Event Center and The Edge Pavi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
