Finishing in the top ten was a breakthrough for the young man. And since then, he’s gone on to fulfill his passion for becoming an actor.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A native of Virginia, Nico has starred in several different TV shows over the years, showcasing his immense talents as an actor and a dancer. Being skilled in two different fields might sound torrid to many, but for Nico, he’s done it with ease.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wiki, Bio, Parents</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Nico Greetham was born on the 5th of March 1995 in Woodbridge, Virginia, to parents Chris Greetham, and Isabella. His father is from Scotland, and his mother is from Colombia, which is why his ethnicity is a mixture of both Scottish and Colombian ancestry.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Laurieann Gibson Married, Family, Net Worth" rel=follow>Laurieann Gibson Married, Family, Net Worth</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Likewise, he grew up alongside two sisters, Gabriella and Natalie Greetham in the family. Nico&nbsp;has a height of 5 feet and 10 inches. He graduated from Osbourn Park High School. As for his dancing and acting skills, he honed them at Virginia's Strictly Rhythm Dance Company. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Dating, Girlfriend, Or Gay?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>When it comes to Nico’s love life, as of 2019, things seemed to have taken a different turn.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Back in early 2018, Nico was in a relationship with his Power Rangers Ninja Steel co-star Zoe Robins. Their relationship was evident by their countless pictures on Twitter and Instagram handle.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Nico Greetham, along with his then-girlfriend, Zoe Robins&nbsp;(Photo: Nico's Instagram | 11th March 2018)&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Interesting:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Jack Matthews Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Gay" rel=follow>Jack Matthews Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Gay</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>But since February 2019, there have not been any pictures of the two together. It could be a possible indication that Nico and Zoe might have split.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Neither Nico nor Zoe have come forth to talk about that matter. They could have taken a break, or might just be enjoying a secluded live life. Until unless either Nico or Zoe come forth to talk about it, nothing can be stated with absolute certainty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Apart from that, Nico’s relationship with Zoe is a clear indication that he is not gay.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Net Worth</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Nico first rose to prominence after his 'Top 10 finish' on the tenth season of the reality television show&nbsp;So You Think You Can Dance. His remarkable performance on the show took his fame to great lengths. And following his stint on the show, he went on a nationwide tour with the ten contestants on the show.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-711 data-method=ai-placeholders class=ezoic-autoinsert-ad></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Following that, he went on to pursue a second passion. As a young boy, Nico had the desire to become an actor, and he made sure to fulfill that passion. He went on to star in Nickelodeon series Power Rangers Ninja Steel as the Yellow Ranger. The 24-years-old actor has enough time to make it big, and in due time with the outstanding effort, he might be an A-list star.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Similar:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Maxi Kleber NBA, Married, Family" rel=follow>Maxi Kleber NBA, Married, Family</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As for his net worth, the current figures remain under wraps, but it could be somewhere around the range of thousands and so forth.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZqehk6R6qL7EnquhmZ1ixKq3yGabmqyZo7RuvMCrnKeso2O1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./acting-vice-principal-hong-kong-school-suspended-sharing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Acting vice-principal at Hong Kong school suspended for sharing poem that wished death on police and</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mikhail-shelkov-from-physics-to-finance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mikhail Shelkov: From Physics to Finance to Aerospace</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
