He currently plays as a wide receiver in the National Football League with the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Nelson has lived the dream of many American footballers as a professional player and has even gone one step further to win the Super Bowl. Since he comes from an athletic family, we don’t need to look far to find what inspired his career path. From the basic details of his biography to his body statistics and his stunning girlfriend, the following is a list of facts about Nelson Agholor’s life and career.</p><h2><strong>Nelson Agholor Biography</strong></h2><p>Nelson Agholor was born on May 24, 1993, in Lagos, Nigeria, the fourth of five children of Caroline and Felix Agholor. His father Felix was a soccer player in Nigeria and moved with his family to the United States when Nelson was just five years old. Nelson has four siblings – two brothers and two sisters. His full name is Nelson Efamehule Agholor. When the Agholors moved to the United States, they lived in a three-room house in Florida, which meant that Nelson shared a room with his older brothers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nelson-Agholor.jpg><p>He attended Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida.

This season is his most successful so far, as he scored more receiver yards and touchdowns than in his two previous seasons combined.</p><p>The biggest game in Agholor’s career was the game against the New England Patriots at Super Bowl 52, which he finished with 84 receiver yards, and the Philadelphia Eagles won the game, which ended 41-33, winning their first Super Bowl in the franchise’s history.</p><h2><strong>His Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Everywhere in the world of male sports, the partners of these athletes have the ability to absolutely blow you away with their beauty.
