Before answering, take a good, long look at your relationship and consider what made you declare your love for your spouse. Here are perfect romantic answers.</p><ul><li>I have grown insanely fond of you, and you are so unique that I want this feeling to last forever.</li><li>Do you know why you're so special to me? It's because even when I tried to hide my flaws and scars, you made me feel comfortable owning them. I can be myself around you: no masks, no hiding, and not pretending to be someone I am not.</li><li>By falling in love with me, you have made me the luckiest person in the universe.</li><li>You are remarkable because you represent a rainbow in human form. You radiate joy, warmth, and love.</li><li>I've been staring at my screen all day, waiting for you to say "Hello."</li><li>Even when you are not present, I can still feel the energy. For sure, I am <a href=#>your soulmate,</a> and you are mine.</li><li>You are unique because you are open and sincere with me. You don't hold back when you criticize me, and you help me become a better person.</li><li>You make me feel grounded, so I'd like to claim that makes you special. Since the moment I laid eyes on you, everything in the world stopped, and all I could think about, feel, touch, and grab onto was you.</li><li>You are my music, muse, and favourite moment of distraction.</li><li>I daydream about you—a future. House, kids, growing old together and dying in each other's arms.</li><li>My moon, my sunshine, and my shot of dopamine. I would spend all my life chasing sunsets with you.</li><li>I wouldn't mind if the world ended today. I would be glad to spend the last day with you.</li><li>I don't want the world, sweetheart. I want you.</li><li>You will never know what you mean or how much you mean to me.</li><li>Another reason I love you is: Time stops when we are together. It's just you and me present in the moment. I want those moments to last forever.</li><li>You complete me.</li><li>Things that keep me sane: our pillow talks, long walks on the beach, and coffee dates.</li><li>You'll know what you mean to me if you could see yourself through my eyes. You will finally realize how special and unique you are.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d3f807de4108d35.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ long love letters for her from the heart to impress her</span></p></a><h2 id=486080-clever-replies-to-quothow-much-do-you-love-mequot class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Clever replies to "how much do you love me"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/89f06e54449f9889.jpg><p class=align-left>If you don't know how to reply to "how much do you love me", use the following replies for your happy relationship and, more importantly, shield yourself from your wife or girlfriend's fury for the upcoming weeks.</p><ul><li>I love you 3000 x 3000 times.</li><li>Not as much as you think I love.
