They are most welcoming and all the ingredients for the delicious full English breakfast are Devon-sourced, including a Colyton sausage from award-winning Anton’s Butchers on Market Place. Colyton thrives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not only does it have a butcher’s, there’s a pharmacy, a library, two convenience stores, a social club and a town hall still in use.
