There could be a number of reasons for the issues.</p><p>But we're here to help. Here are some common problems with Amazon Alexa and how you can fix them.</p><h2 id=finding-smart-devices-with-alexa-isn-t-working>1. Finding Smart Devices With Alexa Isn't Working</h2><p>When Alexa is having trouble finding your smart home device, your first job is to make sure your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">device is actually compatible with Alexa</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you're sure it is, the next step is to check your Alexa app (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android</a>) on your smartphone to see if you can connect the device through there.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_0745.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_0746.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>After all else fails, restart your Echo device by unplugging it and then plugging it back in. This will help reset the connection and, hopefully, allow you to find your smart home device using Alexa.</p><p>Your last resort for this issue, and most other issues on this list, is to factory reset your device. Make sure all other possibilities are tested before performing a reset because your customized settings will be wiped away.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=alexa-doesn-t-stream-music-properly>2. Alexa Doesn't Stream Music Properly</h2><p>If you're having streaming problems with your Alexa it's probably related to either a bad Wi-Fi connection or low bandwidth.</p><p>Try loading a site on your phone and see if you have slow loading times. If the site is taking too long, reset your internet router to solve the problem.</p><p>If you're downloading a movie or playing a game that takes up too much online data, then your problem could be bandwidth-related. Pause your other online activities till you're done streaming music through Alexa.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Spotify will often have problems streaming through Alexa. Disconnect the music service by opening the app and selecting <strong>Settings > Music & Podcasts > Spotify > Disable Skill</strong>. Then try reconnecting it.</p><h2 id=alexa-wi-fi-stopped-working>3. Alexa Wi-Fi Stopped Working</h2><p>Similar to streaming music using Alexa, you want to check your connection when you're having <a href=#>problems with Alexa and your Wi-Fi</a>.</p><p>Usually, your device will start displaying an orange ring light when the Wi-Fi is not working properly. Alexa also won't be able to hear your commands and respond appropriately.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Use another device to test the internet to determine if your router is the source of the problem. It's either that or Alexa is malfunctioning.</p><p>You can restart your router or your Alexa device to see if it helps with the connection. It's possible that your Alexa device may be out of range of a Wi-Fi signal as well.</p><p>Move Alexa closer to the internet router and test the connection after moving. Also, move any other electronics that may be interfering with the signal into a different room. It's possible these could be skewing your connection.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=alexa-isn-t-responding-to-my-voice>4. Alexa Isn't Responding to My Voice</h2><p>Don't take it personally, it could be that Alexa just isn't used to your voice yet. Or, it has too much background interference to make out what you said.</p><p>If the dishwasher is on or someone is vacuuming, try Alexa at a later time when there is less noise. Another solution is to run a vocal test with Alexa so it can become more familiar with your voice.</p><p>To do that, open the Alexa app and select <strong>Settings > Your Profile.</strong> Then select <strong>Manage</strong> next to <strong>Voice</strong>. Finally, you'll choose <strong>Match Voice Profiles</strong>.</p><p>That will start the Voice Training feature. Alexa will prompt you to say 25 different phrases at a normal distance away from the device.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_0749.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_0750.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>After completing the prompts, Alexa will be able to better understand your pronunciation and cadence to personalize your experience.</p><h2 id=alexa-gets-triggered-accidentally>5. Alexa Gets Triggered Accidentally</h2><p>If Alexa thinks it hears its own name, it will turn on accidentally and interrupt whatever you're doing.</p><p>The main reason this happens is that either you, your friends, or the TV said a phrase that sounds similar to "Alexa." To fix this, <a href=#>change the wake phrase</a> to a less common word like Echo.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Alexa will also respond if you ask why it performed a specific action. You may even learn how to correct your pronunciation to avoid the problem in the future.</p><h2 id=playing-music-on-the-wrong-speaker>6. Playing Music on the Wrong Speaker</h2><p>Thanks to Alexa's Multi-Room Audio feature, you can play music from any Echo device in your home by stating the right command.</p><p>The problem is when Alexa turns on the wrong speaker and you hear your music playing from another room in the house.</p><p>To fix this, use the Alexa app to group your devices together. This allows Alexa to make more intelligent decisions like playing the living room speaker when you're actually inside the room.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_0751.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_0752.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Naming your speakers in an appropriate fashion also makes it easier to play the right speaker. If your speaker lives in a specific room, name it after that room. You can say, "Alexa, play my music in the bedroom" to play the right speaker.</p><h2 id=alexa-can-t-perform-a-skill>7. Alexa Can't Perform a Skill</h2><p>With thousands of available skills for Amazon Alexa, it's no surprise you might have trouble playing one or two.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Enable Alexa Skills: 3 Different Ways</a></span></p><p>When that happens, go into your Alexa app and take a look at the skills you've performed. Open the app and select the <strong>More</strong> button and then <strong>Skills & Games</strong>. On that page, select<strong> Your Skills</strong>. Choose the skill you're having problems with and then disable it. Then re-enable it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This simple on and off fix can work pretty well in most cases. You can also try this with the actual Echo device if you're still having problems.</p><p>You also need to make sure you're calling the skill by the correct name. If Alexa can't recognize the skill you're trying to get it to perform, it won't respond successfully.</p><h2 id=alexa-voice-call-doesn-t-work>8. Alexa Voice Call Doesn't Work</h2><p>If your voice calls through Alexa aren't working, check your contact info to see if you have the right information. Alexa can't make the call if the information is incorrect</p><p>You also may not be saying the name clear enough for Alexa to hear you. Ask Alexa what it heard and you'll have a better idea if that is the issue.</p><p>If you previously hooked up your phone number with Alexa to make outgoing calls, you might have noticed all your calls are being received by Alexa as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no great solution to this problem as you will need to turn off the feature to stop receiving calls through Alexa.</p><h2 id=getting-amazon-alexa-working-again>Getting Amazon Alexa Working Again</h2><p>No matter what the problem with your Alexa is, you have a variety of different solutions that can get it up and running again.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If all else fails, try restarting your Alexa then reset your device. With your device working again, you can test all the different skills Alexa has to offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiaqKWdpLturcyasaimXZa5psTAZqCsq6WawG6yyLFm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pilates-for-neck-pain-chronic-stiffness.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cured My Neck, Shoulder, and Upper Back Pain</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-maria-not-bachelorette.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Maria Not the Bachelorette?
