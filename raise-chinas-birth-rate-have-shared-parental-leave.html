In 2017, just over 5 per cent of fathers who qualified for it took the leave, according to the report.</p><p>The situation is better in South Korea, but fathers still only accounted for about 20 per cent of all parental leave taken in 2019, according to its Ministry of Employment and Labour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because many fathers do not use their full allocation of paternity leave, some countries, including Italy and Portugal, have made paternity leave compulsory.</p><p>The Shanghai proposal comes amid heated discussion about the extent to which responsibility for raising children in China falls on women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite some change in attitudes towards fatherhood in the past decade, Chinese fathers are still far less involved in childcare than mothers, especially during a child’s early years, said Li Xuan, an assistant professor of psychology at NYU Shanghai who specialises in fatherhood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a trend reflected around the globe, she said.&nbsp;“The intention behind shared parental leave is certainly laudable. At the very least, this sends a message that allows and encourages men to participate in child rearing.”</p><p>However, when it is left up to couples to decide who takes what proportion of shared parental leave, it is often the mother – who frequently earns less than her partner – that takes up most or all the leave, Li said.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Therefore, asking parents to make fully individual decisions on how they would share the leave does relatively little to boost fathers’ leave uptake, and so does not really help increase the father’s involvement in the early months [of a child’s life] or relieve the burden of mothers,” she said.</p><p>She said the SWF’s proposal was a step in the right direction to nudge fathers to take their leave. However, “the success of such a policy, of course, depends on how it is implemented, its enforcement and financing,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiucilsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofKK%2B06KapZ1faH5zfZRtamiqkZ7ApnnCoaCnmaNir6q%2B06Fkq5mkmnqprdWeZKygkaeypXnPmqmepqSWuW64xJqtng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./today-jenna-bush-hager-wows-tiny-mini-dress-weight-loss-secret-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Bush Hager showcases insane physique in tiny mini dress - surprise secret to slim figure revea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fragrance-date-night-compliments.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>These date night fragrances get compliments without fail</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
