Well for one, USB-C ports are more convenient than chunky USB-A ports, but they also offer <a href=#>fantastic charging speeds and data transfer rates</a>. External drives and hardware (microphones, webcams, controllers, etc) also might start using USB-C, and it just makes sense for your computer to be ready for the future.</p><p>And yes, you could buy a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">USB-C PCIE card</a>&nbsp;for your computer; that's always an option. But these cards take up valuable slots on your motherboard, and do you really want to drop an extra $100 a few months from now just because your new PC case doesn't have a USB-C port built-in?</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for>What to Look For</h2><p>Of course, you can't go around buying expensive computer parts without checking to see whether they fit your needs first. Before shopping for a new computer case, you need to consider what kinds of cases are compatible with your motherboard, what kind of cooling you need, and a whole host of other questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rather than leaving all the work up to you, we've detailed each case's compatibility options and features throughout this article. We've also compiled a handy pre-shopping list, so you know what you need before you fall in love with a computer case:</p><ul><li><strong>Motherboard Compatibility:</strong> Don't buy a case that's too big or small for your motherboard, or a case that isn't compatible with your motherboard. We'll detail each case's motherboard compatibility for your convenience.</li><li><strong>Size and Space:</strong> It's nice to have some extra space in your case. You can use this extra space to install big fans or liquid coolers, funky lights, large GPUs, or just to make cable management a little easier. But keep in mind that a gigantic, heavy computer case might not fit at your desk.</li><li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Generally speaking, extra space leads to extra cooling. If you're super concerned about cooling, look for a spacious case with some good built-in fans.</li><li><strong>Hard Drive Mounts:</strong> Make sure your case has enough mounts for your HDDs and SSDs.</li><li><strong>USB Inputs:</strong> All cases mentioned in this article have at least one USB-C input, but that doesn't necessarily mean every case here has enough USB ports to suit your needs. Don't worry---we'll list the ports available for each case.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now you know what you need from your computer case, it's time to hop right into it. Keep in mind that not too many cases with built-in USB-C ports are on the market just yet, so your options might feel a bit limited.</p><h2 id=full-tower-and-ultra-tower-cases>Full-Tower and Ultra-Tower Cases</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb5c81ed-8.png> be quiet!, Cooler Master<p>Full-tower cases usually work with E-ATX and XL-ATX boards, and they're great for huge, powerful rigs that need a lot of cooling or multiple GPUs.</p><p>Here are some full-tower cases with a built-in USB-C port:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">be quiet! Dark Base Pro 900 V2</a>&nbsp;(E-ATX, XL-ATX):</strong> This 27" tall case is built for demanding setups. It has three built-in "Silent Wings" fans, a relocatable motherboard tray, RGB illumination, a PSU shroud, and an airflow system. It has modular HDD slots that can be used for five HDDs, ten SSDs, and two optical drives simultaneously. As for ports, it has a USB-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, and a built-in Qi wireless charger.</li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow"><strong>Cooler Master Cosmos C700M</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>(E-ATX):</strong> Cooler Master calls this an "ultra-tower" case, and for good reason. It is 25.6" tall, has handles, and is made from sleek glass and aluminum. It has some RGB tech built-in, two fans, and eight PCI slots. But it only has four internal drive bays, one external drive bay, one USB-C port, one USB 3.0 port, and a USB 3.1 port.</li></ul><p>These two full-tower cases have specs comparable to the mid-tower cases below. So if you have an E-ATX motherboard, be sure to read on and fully weigh your options.</p><h2 id=mid-tower-cases>Mid-Tower Cases</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/10fb15c7-6.png> LIAN LI, AORUS <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mid-tower cases are by far the most common PC cases, and they tend to support all motherboard sizes. They offer a good mix of space, ventilation, customization, and PCI expansion. Even if you're set on using a small or large case, it's worth checking out some of these mid-tower cases. Who knows, they might have the features you're looking for.</p><p>Without further ado, here are some mid-tower cases with built-in USB-C ports:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Cooler Master SL600M</a>&nbsp;(E-ATX, ATX, M-ATX, M-ITX):</strong> This 23" tall aluminum and steel case looks like something out of Star Trek. It is built with noise-reduction technology and has one built-in fan. It also has seven expansion slots with support for vertical graphics card installation, eight drive bays, one USB-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports.</li><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">LIAN LI PC-011 Razer Edition</a>&nbsp;(E-ATX, ATX, M-ATX, ITX):</strong> With three sets of Razer LED lighting and a 17.6" tall glass and aluminum shell, this case looks and feels like a real gaming machine. It doesn't have any built-in fans, but it has three sections for radiators (long multi-fans), a dual-PSU tray, eight expansion slots, three HDD bays, and three SSD bays. As for ports, it has a USB-C port and two USB 3.0 ports.</li><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">GIGABYTE AORUS C300 RBG</a>&nbsp;(ATX, M-ATX, Mini-ITX):</strong> This gaming case is 18" tall and made from tempered glass and aluminum. It has one built-in fan, RGB Fusion support, five drive bays, seven PCI slots, and it supports vertical GPU mounts. Port-wise, it has one USB-C port, one USB 3.1 port, and two USB 3.0 ports.</li><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Phanteks Evolv X RGB</a>&nbsp;(E-ATX, ATX, M-ATX, M-ITX):</strong> This 20.5" tall glass and metal case looks fantastic and is actually quite spacious. It can hold 10 HDDs and 9 SSDs simultaneously; it has seven PCI slots, comes with RGB illumination, and has a decent built-in fan. Port-wise, it's a bit lacking---you get one USB-C port and two USB 3.0 ports.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While these mid-tower cases can fit small Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX motherboards, they can be a little over the top for some basic computer builds. If you're looking for a more modest computer case (assuming you're set on a small board), you may want to grab a mini-tower case.</p><h2 id=mini-tower-cases>Mini-Tower Cases</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/09dd8c26-6.png> InWin, OPHION<p>Small mini-tower cases are generally used with Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX motherboards. They're perfect for simple gaming builds that require only one GPU, or for builds geared toward everyday computer use (or streaming, development, etc.).</p><p>Here are some mini-tower cases with USB-C ports built-in:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">OPHION M EVO ALS</a>&nbsp;(M-ATX, ITX, M-ITX):&nbsp;</strong>Do you like boxy cases? This OPHION case is 14" high, sports a brushed aluminum design, and looks more "professional" than most computer cases. It doesn't have any pre-installed fans, but it has enough space for five 120mm fans or a radiator. It also has five drive bays (impressive for the size), two expansion slots, a single USB-C port, and just one USB 3.0 port.</li><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">InWin 301C</a>&nbsp;(M-ATX, M-ITX):</strong> This compact 14.3" tall case is great for basic PC builds. It doesn't have a pre-installed fan, but it has space for a radiator. It also has some rudimentary RGB control, a single hard drive mount, a PSU chamber, and room for a single graphics card. As for ports, it has a single USB-C port and two USB 3.0 ports.</li></ul><p>USB-C is still a relatively new format that hasn't become a standard in computer case manufacturing just yet. That so few USB-C ready cases are currently on the market is frustrating, but that's just how it is right now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you aren't a fan of any of these cases, consider buying a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">USB-C PCIE</a> card. The card will take up some space on your motherboard (bad news if you're obsessed with GPUs and Wi-Fi cards), but it's better than nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhpaWloZnx5ecCwnKynnZp6pLvMqaytnaJisKK%2FxKxksKGknXq2v8FmmmaeoqS7tXnPmqWepKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./asia-monet-ray-wiki-age-height-parents-dancing-ethnicity-2017-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Asia Monet Ray Wiki: From Age to Ethnicity - Everything on The Little Dancing Lady</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./candace-faulkner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Candace Faulkner dating?
