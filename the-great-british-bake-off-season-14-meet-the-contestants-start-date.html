Introducing the class of 2023…</p><h3 dir=ltr>Abbi&nbsp;</h3><p id=el9UcQkaA9a data-wc=86>Born in Yorkshire, Abbi honed her baking skills as a teenager, whipping up plenty of delicious recipes with her mum. A fan of the Victorian era, and the traditional bakes of the time, including steamed puddings and fruit cakes. A lover of the great outdoors, you'll also find Abbi foraging for seasonal ingredients, and growing her own vegetables. Combining comfort and familiarity with a nod to nature, Abbi's bakes have a fairytale feel to them, and we can't wait to see what she creates this season!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f7648bfb7d4c-abbi-bake-off.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Amos&nbsp;</h3><p id=ecifNn52T6m data-wc=73>Film and theatre fan Amos describes his baking style as "traditional with a modern twist." During his childhood in Nottingham, Amos watched in wonder as his mum worked on the most beautiful bakes, and he's followed in her footsteps ever since. When it comes to creating new recipes, Amos isn't afraid to explore different flavour profiles, so we reckon he could be this season's wild card, and create something totally new and unexpected.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/86a25fbe691a-british-bakeof-amos.jpg><p id=evn46zVYME data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Bake Off shares first look at new host Alison Hammond in tent with Noel Fielding</a></p><p id=eBiRQ2eWWt data-wc=11><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Who is Paul Hollywood's girlfriend? Everything you need to know</a></p><h3 dir=ltr>Cristy&nbsp;</h3><p id=eg2ZxIgTONL data-wc=64>As a doting mum of four, Cristy has spent plenty of time baking birthday cakes, and other mouth-watering recipes. Describing her style as "enchanted and pretty," Cristy also draws flavour inspiration from her own Israeli heritage and from her husband's Jamaican roots. The GBBO website credits Cristy as a "dab hand with decoration" so we'll be looking to her for the most beautiful designs.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/174d0372c771-cristy-british-bake-off.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Dan&nbsp;</h3><p id=eT422alcTS3 data-wc=67>Dan's love of cooking was sparked by his 2007 travels to South America. With a penchant for pies and puddings, Dan's also a pro at shortcrust pastry, thanks to some top tips from his mother-in-law. A perfectionist in everything he does, Dan's happy to take on the most difficult recipes in each and every cookbook he owns, so it sounds like he's gonna deliver some jaw-dropping bakes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ebdb1f1d9460-british-bake-off-dan.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Dana&nbsp;</h3><p id=e8upCAnl6aV data-wc=73>A self-professed untidy baker, Dana is all about experimenting. After discovering her passion for baking at the age of 16, Dana quickly became her family's go-to celebration cake-maker. With a "rustic and homely" style that's always a treat to the eye, Dana loves a semi-naked cake with neat lines, pretty piping and minimalist decoration, but she also loves adding a twist or two, usually by incorporating familiar spices associated with her Indian heritage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3c3b8ef06490-british-bake-off-dana.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Josh&nbsp;</h3><p id=e8XYWdwxAzYk data-wc=60>A chemist by trade, Josh is known for his precision, plus an enthusiasm for experimenting. When it comes to inspiration, Josh looks to old baking books which he uses to reinvent classic recipes with a contemporary twist. With dreams of having his own artisan bakery one day, we're looking forward to seeing what Josh brings to the table (pun intended). &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/516a203ce418-josh-british-bakeoff.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Keith&nbsp;</h3><p id=eK3mFA0zWXK3 data-wc=85>Keith began baking from a young age, whipping up Apple pies, fairy cakes and traditional dishes from his mum's home in Malta. Keen to take on a challenge, complex bakes are part of Keith's repertoire, and he's recently been looking to baking books from the early 1970s to attempt recipes that were one "beyond" him. Among his specialties, Keith is particularly fond of baking bread, and his partner Sue and adorable poodle Masie, regularly wake up to the heavenly smell of a freshly baked loaf.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/77bcbe82a149-british-bake-off-keith.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Matty</h3><p id=eY1e19XPCl6t data-wc=72>Matty has learnt the tricks of the trade from online patisserie videos, and he's now his family's designated baker. A fan of more traditional flavours, Matty loves to incorporate chocolate, citrus and nuts into his recipes, which he also describes as "rustic but neat." Following his time in the tent, Matty has another big challenge on his hands, as he prepares to make his own wedding cake, commissioned by his fiancée, Lara.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/47449bc9511a-matty-bake-off.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Nicky&nbsp;</h3><p id=eOOuw-nm60Lq data-wc=64>Nicky's fondest memories took place at her Gran's kitchen table, where she'd roll out pastries and decorate cakes. While pastries are her forte, Nicky's also a skilled baker of bread and regularly creates different breads and birthday cakes for her niece and grandchildren. "Like a pair of comfy old slippers; little traditional bakes that evoke fond memories," is how Nicky describes her baking style.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/87bc0cc9e8e7-great-british-bakeoff-nicky.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Rowan</h3><p id=epiMffG3aJSt data-wc=59>Scones, pork pies, shortbread and traditional jam tarts are among Rowan's earliest baking memories. A student of English Literature, Rowan's uni friends are constantly impressed by his culinary skills, and he recently baked the most epic 21st birthday cake – a three-tier, 12-layer masterpiece. "Go big, or go home," is this baker's motto, so we're hoping for a showstopper!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/676da203539e-rowan-british-bakeoff.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Saku&nbsp;</h3><p id=e4TDRtzv-Hrd data-wc=60>Born in Sri-Lanka, Saku loves to use the traditional flavours of her heritage, including curry spices, in her savoury bakes. When it comes to sweeter recipes however, cinnamon, cardamom and nutmeg are among her go-to flavours. A self-taught baker, Saku's children often discover plenty of homemade treats in their lunchboxes, which she's replicated from snacks she's seen in the supermarket.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/29951fb4cf04-bake-off-saku.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Tasha&nbsp;</h3><p id=eP9QlkbKlUNw data-wc=62>Rounding out the class of 2023 is Tasha, a theatre fan with a fearless approach to baking. It was during her childhood that she discovered her passion for baking, and during secondary school she was quickly encouraged by her Food Technology teacher to pursue it further. For Tasha, baking is an outlet for creativity, and she's particularly interested in curating near-impossible designs.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e009c459e39d-british-bakeoff-tasha.jpg><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
