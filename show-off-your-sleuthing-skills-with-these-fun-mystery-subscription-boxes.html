They're also crystal clear about content warnings, in case they contain subject matter that may not be appropriate for younger kids (like murder).</p><p>These immersive mystery story boxes are tons of fun and a great way to shake up date night or family get-togethers from the comfort of your living room.

In fact, the first box includes a combination of letters, forensic reports, newspapers, archival documents, and other items for you to sift through.
