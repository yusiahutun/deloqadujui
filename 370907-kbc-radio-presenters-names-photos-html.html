If you are an avid listener of Swahili station then some of your favourite radio hosts must be from KBC. In the early 1920s, the only radio station that Kenyans could listen to was Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), formerly known as the Voice of Kenya (VOK). During that time, a radio would be placed in a strategic place to make it easier to listen to news, music, entertainment, sports, or local programmes.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8cac892585d98501.png><p class=align-left>However, as more radio stations were formed, KBC had to up their game to remain relevant to the old generation and millennials.
