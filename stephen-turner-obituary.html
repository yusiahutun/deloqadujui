From 1987 until 1990 he was head of the environmental division of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, calculating compensation for villagers whose lands were flooded by dams built to provide water to South Africa, and power and income to Lesotho.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In 1990 Stephen moved to the Free University of Amsterdam as a development consultant, carrying out assignments across southern Africa. From 1994, at the University of Namibia, he worked on conservation and land reform; and from 1996, at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town, on sustainable land use and agrarian reform for some of the poorest and most remote communities in South Africa.</p><figure id=2b88de12-039c-4f67-8c5c-1199018599af data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>In 2007 Stephen Turner joined the Oxford-based international development consultancy Mokoro</span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In 2000, he returned to the Free University, carrying out nature conservation and rural development projects for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Unicef, the World Health Organization and other groups in countries including Costa Rica, Yemen, Palestine, Bangladesh, Timor Leste and many in Africa.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Stephen was born in Kaduna, Nigeria, the elder son of British parents, John Turner, a university professor, and Susan (nee Hovey), a teacher. In 1961, the family moved to Exeter in Devon. Hearing the cathedral’s great bells and the organ in the icy winter of 1962-63 left an enduring impression on him.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>From 1965 to 1972 Stephen attended Waterford Kamhlaba school in Swaziland (now Eswatini) in southern Africa. <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Lourenço Marques Radio</a> introduced him to pop, rock and soul. With South Africa under apartheid, Waterford drew students from across the continent.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Stephen studied geography at Cambridge, then for his geography PhD at Soas University of London learned Sesotho and lived for a year in the village of Ha Tumahole in the Maluti mountains of Basutoland (now Lesotho). Hitchhiking from Swaziland to Lesotho in 1974, he met Monono Matsaba. They married in Manchester in 1986 and had two sons, Mothusi and Karabo.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In 2007 he went freelance, working as principal consultant and, from 2017, director of the Oxford-based international development consultancy Mokoro. Three years later, Stephen and his family returned to Manchester, close to where our parents were living. He said of his continued work in Lesotho: “This was the happiest part of the job for me … working at village level, addressing public meetings in Sesotho, driving those wild, beautiful mountain roads, breathing the high Maluti air.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Stephen enjoyed a Maluti beer (or two) on a last visit to Lesotho in January 2023.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He is survived by Monono, Mothusi and Karabo, our mother, Susan, and me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ%2BcpK%2BiuIydnK%2BdnKS9rrHNrWZraGJofKLBxmhnbGejqbKxtMSnZK2toqOys3nOm6CtrZGnxg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cheat-code-podcast-episode-85-lets-go-on-tour.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Cheat Code Podcast: Episode 85 Lets Go On Tour!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-watch-me-bleed-by-tears-for-fears.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Watch Me Bleed by Tears for Fears</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-christmas-hats-for-virtual-parties.html>10 best Christmas hats for virtual festive parties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-mind-blowing-facts-about-klementinum-library.html>14 Mind-blowing Facts About Klementinum Library</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devon-windsor-wedding.html>Inside Devon Windsor &amp;amp; Johnny Barbara's Wedding in St. Barths</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-z-takes-daughters-blue-ivy-12-and-rumi-6-to-the-superbowl-and-they-look-so-much-like-mom-beyonce.html>Jay-Z takes daughters Blue Ivy, 12, and Rumi, 6, to the Superbowl - and they look so much like mom B</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./542770-marjorie-harveys-net-worth-steve-harvey-marriage.html>Marjorie Harvey's net worth before and after Steve Harvey marriage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash.
