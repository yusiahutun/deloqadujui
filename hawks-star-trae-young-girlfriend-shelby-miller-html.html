She attended the University of Oklahoma and that’s where she met her beau. Young was part of the Oklahoma Sooners basketball team and Miller was a member of the school’s cheerleading squad. They have reportedly been dating since 2018.</p><p id=par-4_68>According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook profile</a>, she now lives in Atlanta, Georgia, where Young plays. These days she’s his biggest cheerleader and was on hand when he played the Knicks at MSG. Being in attendance means she heard the opposing fans chanting negative comments about her man. But as Young told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audacy’s V-103</a>, he actually views that as “a sign of respect” [because] “they’re not doing that for everybody.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 id=h-the-couple-posted-plenty-of-videos-together-during-quarantine>The couple posted plenty of videos together during quarantine</h2><p id=par-5_34>Miller is active on social media and has posted photos of her boyfriend.

Cameras cut to him on the couch with his girlfriend, Crymson Rose, while chatting with his new team. The clip, which quickly circulated on the internet, shows Rose take Lamb’s cell phone before he grabs it back out of her hand. Social media dubbed it the “phone snatch” and thousands of people commented including Young.</p><p id=par-10_43>“Bruh said ‘nahhhh what you doin,” the Hawks guard wrote alongside a retweet of the video.
